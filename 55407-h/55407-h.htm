<h2>LETTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Frederick to Emily Douglas.</span></h2>

<p>This, my dearest Emily, is the last letter
which you will receive from Frederick in London;
and though time speeds on rapid wing in
this focus of attraction, I reckon the days with
impatience till the heath-clad tops of our dear
mountains break upon my view. To travel,
and see new men and manners, would be too
delightful, if mother and sisters were with me,
but, unfashionable as the confession may be, I
own to the <i>weakness</i> of loving mine enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
make me wish to be always near them. In a
few days we are to set out, and Arthur starts
for France, when we turn our faces towards
Glenalta. I fear that my uncle is not gaining
ground; there is a consultation every day, but
it seems to me as if many of these great doctors
make up in <i>mannerism</i> of one sort or other
what they want in penetration. One assumes a
rough tone, and thinks it for his advantage to
act the brute, in order to assure his patients that
he is an honest man. Another looks as smooth
as satin, and prescribes such numerous and
expensive remedies, that none but a nabob could
afford to be cured. A third experiments upon
all the vegetables and minerals in the modern
Pharmacopœia, and “thrice slays the slain,”
before he stumbles by accident on the disease.
If I am to be killed by Esculapian skill, I would
rather receive my <i>quietus</i> from a sober practitioner
in the country, who had never heard of
<i>arsenic</i>, <i>digitalis</i>, or the <i>prussic acid</i>, than be
torn piece-meal by a triad of London physicians,
who, ten to one, know as little of the
case as of the constitution submitted to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and ceremoniously agree to put one out of the
world with the profoundest adherence to etiquette.
I cannot help thinking the business
altogether a solemn farce, which I long to see
brought to a conclusion, and as I am growing
every day more and more attached to this near
and dear relation, I look anxiously for his removal,
from what appears to me, a pick-pocket
confederacy. The dread with which my uncle’s
manner at first inspired me, is gradually wearing
away. With Phil. and me he is charming,
full of information, classical taste, and literary
criticism. He has a fund of humour also,
which gives variety to his powers of pleasing;
and when bodily pain does not weigh upon his
spirits, he is a delightful companion, whose
society will add considerably to the pleasures of
our winter fire-side. But his frown is as awful
as his smile is beaming, and would have petrified
me long ago, if I had ever encountered his
brow in the act of concentrating its forces upon
me, as it does when aunt Howard and Louisa
appear in his presence. The whole horizon of
his forehead is then hung thickly in clouds, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
morose expression marks his countenance, and
a sullen silence indicates displeasure, as far as
the rules of common civility will permit. With
Arthur he is less unconstrained than with me;
but I hope that ere we quit London, there will
be no difference in his feelings towards us. The
kind partiality with which he treats your Frederick
is easily accounted for, and arises <i>not</i>
from any comparison between the individuals in
question, or <i>I</i> could not be his favourite. I
should write with more satisfaction than I feel
at present, if I were not so soon to see you; but
the slowness of my pen makes me impatient,
when I reflect on the <i>glibness</i> of tongue with
which I hope in less than a fortnight to pour out
all my news <i>vivâ voce</i>, for your amusement.
Besides, when once the novelty of the thing is
over, there is a tiresome monotony in the routine
of a London life.</p>

<p>I have met with very few who deserve to be
recorded for any qualifications that distinguish
individuals from each other. A certain number
of airs, and affectations, mixed with accomplishments
and French flounces, in proportions a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
little varying, but producing generally the same
result, may serve as a recipe by which to compound
the modern belle; and for the beau, a
mixture somewhat different, without being in
the least more solid, will suffice as universally
as the former; but Arthur procured me an invitation
the other day to a dinner party, which
being unlike its predecessors, I must particularize,
reserving the names of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>,
till we meet, lest my letter should <i>miss
stays</i>, and its writer be prosecuted for a libel.</p>

<p>This dinner was given by a literary amateur,
to several authors and authoresses, who furnish
our <i>running account</i> of novels, essays, disquisitions
reviews, articles, fugitive poems, squibs,
and <i>bon mots</i>. And in the evening we had a
numerous accession of both sexes, who were
brought together as professedly <i>bookish</i> people,
and therefore fit audience for the writers who, I
suppose, were expected to be speakers also. I
know, that I for <i>one</i>, went fully possessed with
the idea, that at least I should hear a great
<i>quantity</i> of discourse, however I might chance to
think of its <i>quality</i>; and, moreover, I was rejoicing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for two entire days at the prospect that
lay before me: but disappointment was the portion
of every novice, who, like myself, looked
for “a feast of reason and a flow of soul.” Of
all the dull uninteresting meetings of which I
ever happened to be a member, I willingly vote
the palm of pre-eminence to that at Sir Marmaduke
Liston’s. However, as knowledge is
always valuable, I stand indebted to that assembly
for one piece of information, which, till
now, I have taken upon hearsay evidence.</p>

<p>It was in Lady Liston’s drawing room that I
first saw that gorgon, yclept “<i>Blue-stocking</i>,”
which we used to think was like other spectres,
the offspring of a distempered imagination. I
can assure you that such things are, and, if I
was heartily disgusted with the authors at dinner,
I was no less heartily nauseated by the
<i>Blues</i> at tea. The former only reminded me of
rival tradesmen, who forgot a part of their craft,
namely, adulation of their patron, in the absorbing
energy of their hatred towards each
other. As to <i>conversation</i>, we had none, for
every man seemed afraid to utter a sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
lest his neighbour should slip it into <i>a book</i>, and
thus defraud the real owner. A few nods,
shrugs, and <i>hahs</i>, which might be interpreted
<i>ad libitum</i>, occupied the place of language, and
constituted nearly the whole intercourse of
<i>mind</i> which was not directed to the <i>matter</i> of
fish, flesh, and fowls. On <i>these</i>, indeed, and
their individual merits, our <i>wittenagemot</i> were
eloquent “with all alliteration’s artful aid;” and
they also proved themselves nothing loath to
exercise whatever critical <i>acumen</i> any of them
possessed on Sir Marmaduke’s wines which
were discussed from humble port to imperial
tokay, with glistening eyes, glazed noses, and
expanding vests. Yet you may tell Mr.
Oliphant that we had not even <i>allusion</i> to a
feast of the ancients, not a word of old Falernian,
nor a single glimmering of classic lore,
though in the fields of Horace one would
imagine that the company might have expatiated
on neutral ground without danger of petty
larceny on any side. One prodigious person,
who seemed like “Behemoth, biggest born,”
and who quaffed accordingly, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
diverted me: he sat next to a tall thin phantom
who looked of Pharoah’s lean kine, and wore a
little black cap on his skull, which appeared as
if “moulded on a porringer,” This shadowy
form was, I was told, a metaphysician, and certainly
he gave me the idea of having come into
the world for the express purpose of illustrating
the extension of tenuity. He drank nothing
but toast and water, and consequently had the
advantage of preserving such store of faculties
as he brought to the entertainment, in all their
clearness, when his neighbours were “veiled in
mist;” but either the measure was so small, or
the nature of his <i>wares</i> prevented them from
being pilfered. Whatever the reason, so it was,
that he seemed to enjoy all the ease of a sinecure
in guarding his mental property from
depredation. He, and his ample companion,
threw glances at each other of mutual contempt
every now and then, and from time to time, as
opportunity presented itself, kept up at intervals
a meagre snarl, altogether divested of wit
or point, till the big man, who, of a class that
it might be presumed</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Had but seldom known the use</div>
<div class="verse">Of the grape’s surprising juice,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>became so top heavy, that I saw his head gently
let down, as if by a pully and tackle, on the
shoulder of the metaphysician, who not inclined
to enact the prop to a fallen foe, disengaged
himself so abruptly from this mountain of the
muses (for Behemoth is a poet), that the chair
on which he sat, having glided away, the latter
came down on the floor plump, like a full sack
that had broken from the crane. My gravity
was not proof against this downfall of Parnassus,
and I made my way up stairs as quickly as
I could, only lagging behind a sufficient length
of time for the water-drinking philosopher to
be lodged before me. Oh ye gods, what an
exhibition did I open upon! the only similitude
which I can find at hand for the drawing-room
that presented itself, was a glass of some highly
bottled liquid, in which a froth of white muslin
occupied the upper, and a sediment of black
cloth its lower extremity. Not a sound was to
be heard as I entered the room; but I soon
perceived that the <i>et ceteras</i> of coffee, tea, cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and bread and butter, were not at all more indifferent
in the superior, than soups, meats, and
wine had been in the inferior regions of this
intellectual <i>festum</i>. It quite astonished me to
see the quantity of all these appurtenances of
the <i>soireé</i>, that almost immediately vanished,
“leaving not a wreck behind.” During the
consumption of these mere <i>creatures</i> of the
entertainment, certain solemn sentences were
fired at intervals, after the manner of minute
guns, each succeeded by a deadly pause.</p>

<p>The gentlemen below stairs sat a long time,
but I was resolved to see <i>out</i> the evening, ere I
passed judgment on a party of the literati. At
length the authors ascended, and, had I been a
young lady, I should have felt most unwilling</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;&mdash;“to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence</div>
<div class="verse">Of such late wassailers;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but the habits of the <i>trade</i> triumphed over the
occasional excess which Sir Marmaduke’s hospitality
had caused his guests to commit, and so
profoundly discreet was this book-making assembly,
that while, on the one hand, not a
syllable that betrayed either taste or genius escaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and laid them open to plagiarism, I must do justice
to the equal taciturnity which they observed
upon every subject less immediately connected
with the direct views of their calling; insomuch,
that, for the greater number, they withstood the
most pedantic efforts, on the side of the <i>blues</i>, to
draw them out, and&mdash;with the exception of some
tedious verbiage pronounced, <i>ex cathedrâ</i>, by
the man in the black cap, who, perceiving the
advantage which his abstemiousness gave him
over the rest, grew loquacious and collected a
circle of ladies around him&mdash;One might have
imagined that rumination was the object of the
meeting, and that the members of this tiresome
confraternity had come together principally for
the purpose of feeding first, and then chewing
the cud on the subjects of their next lucubrations.
I never was so weary of the “human
face divine,” as on the memorable occasion
which I have mentioned, and gladly banished
all recollection of a party, over which the goddess
of dulness had especially presided&mdash;in the
most leaden slumber that I have experienced
since my arrival in the British capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall part from Arthur with such sorrow as
a brother’s love might feel. He must positively
be a changeling in his mother’s house, so entirely
does he differ from his family. Yet in
Louisa there are, as our country taylor would
say, “<i>the makings</i>” of something good, had she
received a decent education. But empty heads
and flinty hearts are quite <i>the thing</i>; and if nature
throw away her labours, and, forgetting the
class on which she is operating, lavish fine faculties
and gentle affections on one of your <i>exquisites</i>,
whether male or female, these, like
troublesome excrescences, must be amputated;
and a better hand at performing such a species
of excision cannot exist than that of my aunt.
Her influence is enough to eradicate the deepest
sensibilities, and cut to the quick the most promising
intellect. She cannot bear me, because
my uncle takes kind notice of me, and it is time
that we should part; for a day in Grosvenor
Square seems to me as if passed in purgatory;
though Arthur is there.</p>

<p>With true loves, adieu, and believe me</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate</p>

<h2>LETTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Frederick Douglas.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Paris.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear Fred.</p>

<p>Your letter, announcing safe return to the
“happy valley,” found me on the very eve of
my departure to Dover. Need I say how welcome
it was?&mdash;Yes, you did indeed describe
your feelings to one who could participate in
every sensation, and feel every beat of your
heart, as the well known land marks, the <i>termini</i>
that bound your glen of enchantment, rose
smiling in the western beam, above the misty
fleece which had rolled over their summits from
the sea. I saw the first faggot blaze on the peak
of Lisfarne; I heard the first joyous announcement
of Tom Collins, the eager bark of Gelert,
Eva, and Bran, the din of voices, the pattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of bare feet across every path-way in the bog;
in short, what incident, however trifling, was a
stranger to my breast that prepared for the final
folding in your mother’s arms?</p>

<p>How different my journey and my arrival at
its termination! I could have joined several
gay parties, proceeding in the same route which
I was about to tread; but I was not in a humour
for such company as they offered, and so
I preferred commencing my travels <i>solus</i>, Lewis
being only an appendage who permits me to
be more alone than I should be without him,
by taking all the minor cares that belong to
<i>chemin faisant</i> off my shoulders.</p>

<p>My mother and Louisa were to leave town on
the day after I set out, and are by this time at
Selby&mdash;would that I could say enjoying the
quiet of that beautiful place; but the former,
poor soul, is not happy any where, and my sister,
alas, though she feels little pleasure in the scenes
which she has left behind, cannot be expected to
derive much from those which in providing food,
and giving time for meditation, bring no peace
to a bosom at war within itself. Louisa, I predict,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
will be an altered character, but the work
will be slow, and experience many interruptions.
I see, however, some very promising circumstances
on which to build my hopes. Adelaide’s
marriage is already acting as a salutary beacon;
and I have extorted a faithful promise from Louisa
that she will no longer give encouragement
to Lord G. Villiers, whose attentions, if they
ended in a serious address, would be directed by
the same base motives which brought Crayton
and Adelaide together. Thus one great point
is gained, but every step which I achieve with
Louisa, throws me farther back in my mother’s
regard; so the task is like that of Sisyphus, and
very disheartening.</p>

<p>On reaching this place, I received letters
from Falkland, and one from my brother-in-law,
entreating my interference with my uncle for a
loan. This I must peremptorily refuse, and
cordially do I wish that the latter had returned
home a poor man, that such of his family, as
are inclined to love him, might indulge the feeling
without suspicion of its purity; and that
such as would prey upon his very vitals, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
regard to any thing but the most sordid self-interest,
should be kept from persecuting and injuring
his fine mind, by increasing the measure
of its distrust. He is not fond of me, but I love
him because he has good taste enough to distinguish
you. Say every thing kind and respectful
to him for me, which you do not think
him likely to reject, and with tender loves to the
rest of the dear group, I am, dearest Frederick,
in haste,</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">A. Howard</span>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h2>LETTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Douglas to Mrs. E. Sandford.</span></h2>

<p>You would have reason, my Elizabeth, to
complain of my silence, were your heart less
alive than it is to the interesting occupations
which have devolved upon your friends of the
valley; and though I am blessed with such coadjutors
as few can boast, there is employment
for us <i>all</i> in our several departments.</p>

<p>My dear brother’s health declines so slowly,
that the progress of disease is scarcely perceptible,
and deceives all the young group, as well as
the sanguine Oliphant; but I feel that Edward
Otway and I are prophets but too true when we
agree in prognosticating a termination to all his
sufferings, whether of mind or body, that belong
to this world, and that too at no great distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of time. He has been so wearied out by medicines,
that he now resolves on trying the effects
of a system in which nature and affection shall
be chief instruments. I submit to his views
in the full belief that a winter’s repose is necessary
to his existence, and as my solicitude is increased
by the responsibility which we encounter
in permitting this dear invalid to remain so
far removed from what is called “the best advice,”
you may suppose how continually my
thoughts are employed about him.</p>

<p>I had been prepared by Edward Otway’s letters,
while he remained in London, for finding
my brother’s character deeply interesting; but
I had no notion in what degree, and my heart
still lingers with him in the moments of our necessary
separation. He is a theme so engrossing,
that I could dilate much more upon it than
the limits which I have prescribed to myself
will allow; but all that I have not time to write,
you shall one day hear, for I lay up every word
that he utters, not only because of the intrinsic
value which I attach to his sentiments and opinions,
but they derive a sacredness from his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
situation (hovering as the bright spirit now
is upon the confines of eternity), which keeps
me almost breathless in his company, lest I
should lose a syllable that falls from his lips.
You already know what a <i>mine</i> we have discovered,
of the richest treasure, under that scaly
armour, in which he had fortified himself against
the anticipated assaults of such sordid principles
as he was accustomed to see govern the conduct
of those men with whom early habit had associated
him. Imagine then the happiness of seeing
all this rough coating drop off, and present
the sweetest, most confiding nature to our
view.</p>

<p>You and I have often watched the unfolding
of that beautiful zoophyte, the sea anemone,
when, after having been left exposed, by the
retreat of the waves from its rocky asylum, to the
chilling influence of a northern blast, it expanded
its delicate fibres to the soft returning
tide; and from a shrunk and shapeless thing,
opened into a star of glowing and transparent
brilliancy. Just in such manner has the noble
mind of our precious invalid been blighted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the pitiless storms which rage along the coasts
of avarice and self-interest. In such manner
also has he unlocked his soul in this little sheltered
bay, to the gentle flow of affection. How
thankful do I feel for the blessing of being permitted
to see this hour, and bear a part in the
scene which Glenalta now exhibits!</p>

<p>The process of change too has been as quick
as it is gratifying; a cautious and alternating advance
and recession would have been the history
of an ordinary mind, but the impulses of a generous
character are instinctive and uncalculating.
They yielded at once in my brother to the force
of truth; and that reserve which is still occasionally
observable in his manner, expresses nothing
like the coldness of doubt, but seems only
to say, “alas! why has this native element of
kindness, this congenial sympathy, been so long
withheld, and why am I only learning, for the
first time, to bask in the warm sunshine, when
the orb of day is descending from his meridian,
and hastening to hide his radiant beams in the
deep?” So powerfully do I feel impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with a belief that this is the secret language of
his heart, that my eyes too often betray me, and
I am obliged to hurry from his presence, that I
may avoid discovering my emotion.</p>

<p>One little incident alone proclaimed the
slightest vacillation in his mind since he came
here, and as it ended happily, and bore evidence
to the delicacy of my dear Frederick’s feeling, I
have pleasure in recording it.</p>

<p>A letter from Arthur, in which he expressed
a wish that his uncle had returned poor, in order
to enjoy the luxury of being loved, with freedom
from the base insinuations that restrain the manifestation
of affection, and also speaking the
pleasure which he experienced in the certainty
that his cousin is more highly considered than
himself, was received, and shewn to me some
time ago, by my dear boy. Some allusion being
made to news from Arthur, my brother asked
one or two questions about him, which Frederick’s
first unguarded movement led him to answer,
by putting his friend’s letter into his
uncle’s hands; but instantly recollecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
passage which I have mentioned, he altered his
purpose, and blushed so violently while he made
an awkward reply, that a brow for the first time
overcast by clouds of suspicion, met my poor
fellow’s eye, and occasioned an unspeakable
agony in his mind, which he saw no means of
relieving; for the same nice feeling that had
stayed his first impulse, forbade him to explain
the subsequent embarrassment; yet he saw that
an unfavourable surmise, perhaps detracting
from Arthur’s honorable motives, was the alternative.
Mr. Otway was in the room when this
incident occurred, and mentioned it to me in
private. I immediately unravelled the mystery,
produced the letter for this dear friend,
who shewed it without Frederick’s knowledge,
or mine, to his uncle; and the result
has been the most perfect understanding
on all sides, and the completest re-establishment
of confidence on the part of my amiable
guest.</p>

<p>My brother speaks with joy of never parting
from me, and as every consideration must give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
place to the hope of protracting his existence, I
shall not oppose his wishes, though I augur a
removal from my cell, which I never before contemplated,
in fulfilling them. My poor invalid
talks of the Continent for next spring, and has
heard so much of Turin, that thither he has set
his heart on going in quest of that which he will
never find. What is so far distant, may never
come to pass; but I must prepare for it, and
<i>you</i> know how painful to me is change of place;
yet the bitterest potion is mercifully diluted for
us, if we attempt to perform a <i>duty</i> with cheerfulness;
and He who “tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb,” will sustain me through whatever
trials may be in prospect.</p>

<p>Winter has been for many years a heavy season
with me. Long nights of watchfulness, and
sad musing, impede the progress of our daily
task; and the summer has been my comforter&mdash;its
warm sunshine tempts abroad; its bowery
shades invite to rest; its long days furnish occupation,
and its short nights are often sweetly
passed in gazing on the starry host, and pondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on those mansions of eternal blessedness that
lie beyond the firmament. But this is mere indulgence,
selfish indulgence, and my present
cares have taught me a lesson, which I ought to
have learned before. Engaged now from morning
till night in trying to assuage the sufferings
of another, I have not time to dwell on sorrow of
my own; and winter glides away unperceived,
except by the rapidity of its flight.</p>

<p>It will rejoice you to learn that our <i>great</i> concern
prospers; and the earnest desire to infuse
“that peace which passeth all understanding”
into the sinking spirit, has been blessed with
success beyond our hopes. No formal siege, no
angry attack, no querulous disputation has been
opened here upon error and scepticism. We
read, we converse, but we patiently wait for the
troubling of the waters ere assistance is offered.
The <i>forcing</i> system surely deters many from entering
the lists of proselytism from the evil of
their ways. You have often heard me say that
there is nothing like Butler’s Analogy for minds
of a certain calibre, which must have strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
food. <i>Here</i> is a new instance in proof of its excellence.
Our invalid is charmed with this
masterly work, and pores over it incessantly.
We have got Tremaine too, of which so many
various opinions are in circulation: but as we
have not yet finished it, I do not say more at
present.</p>

<p>Adieu, dearest friend,</p>

<h2>LETTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Frederick Douglas to Arthur Howard.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Glenalta.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">Dearest Arthur,</p>

<p>Our letters to and fro, seem all to have
reached their several destinations in safety, and
yours have truly been a rich resource this winter
in our retirement. Little did I imagine when we
parted, that you and I were likely to meet in a
foreign territory before we shook hands once
more at Glenalta; but this letter is actually to
be your manifesto of full power to treat in my
uncle’s name for all such accommodations as
may suit his circumstances and the number of
our party at Turin, whither you are directing
your steps, you say, and where you may expect
to see us all, Mr. Oliphant excepted, in two
months, should no unforeseen interventions mar
the present plan of proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>How extraordinarily the most unlooked for
events come round, and sometimes turn up the
very thing that we most desire, and which
seemed the least within our own power to accomplish!</p>

<p>My college course just finished, my degree
taken, and the mind experiencing the <i>pains</i> of
liberty, not its <i>pleasures</i>, how delightful is this
new direction of its activity! I cannot describe
the feelings with which I paid my last accounts
to Alma Mater, and took leave <i>for ever</i> of a
heap of books which now that I am not obliged
to read, I dare say I shall never be likely to
open again.</p>

<p>Well, man is surely a perfect enigma! <i>Venteroli</i>,
<i>La Place</i>, <i>La Croix</i>, all those volumes
with the red, blue, and yellow, covers, which
when lying on my table you used to call my
<i>parterre of tulips</i>, and at which I have often
worked till my mind was reduced to a state of
complete inanition, became objects of affection
when the task was finished,&mdash;<i>not</i> that I had any
inclination to continue the toil, when the necessity
for it had ceased; but I regretted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
absence of that necessity, and sat mournfully
gazing on those books which I had longed so
often to lay upon the shelf. I felt exactly, I
dare say, as a piece of clock-work would tell us
that it does, were it able to speak, when the
main spring, after being wound up to the utmost
extremity of tension, is suddenly let go,
and flies back with proportionate and painful
velocity. In short, I know not how to express
the collapsed, unstrung, nerveless condition of
my mind, which I suppose was somewhat over
wrought by study, and the repose for which I
had so often sighed, had so little rest for me
when it arrived, that I should gladly have preferred
the labour of a coal porter to the relaxation
which I had been anticipating with such
impatience.</p>

<p>Doctor Evelyn is certainly right, when he
says that every gratification to be truly felt,
must be <i>earned</i>; and when I ceased to <i>earn</i>, I
ceased to enjoy. All this egotism would be unpardonable
if it were not necessary to your
right understanding of my present gratitude for
the delightful excitement in prospect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Emily, Charlotte, Fanny, and I, have something
new and stimulating to talk of, and our
preparations for quitting home already occupy
hands as well as heads. We build castles, lay
plans, read books with reference to our <i>travels</i>,
and, by-the-bye, Em. and I are so completely
bitten by the idea of visiting the vallies of Piémont,
that I prepare you now for being pressed
into the service. We are longing, too, to be acquainted
with your friend Falkland: and dear
Phil. who has promised my poor uncle to accompany
the party, writes to Stanhope to meet
us at Turin with Mr. Oliphant, junior. So
really it is quite an <i>embarras de richesses</i>, and
I should be too happy were it not for a few
counteracting circumstances which put a wholesome
log about my neck, and restrain my buoyancy
from breaking into any indecorous exuberance.</p>

<p>The first in magnitude of these, is my
uncle’s state of health, which hangs a cloud over
our spirits. He is so much beloved by us all,
that to witness his decline, gentle and almost
imperceptible as it is, gives the truest pain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
every heart at Glenalta. For a long time after
he arrived here, I resisted conviction, and could
not believe that my dearest mother was not influenced
by morbid melancholy in her forebodings;
but she was too well skilled in every
symptom of the disease to doubt its progress;
and I grieve to say that every day adds testimony
to the correctness of her predictions. Nothing
immediate is to be dreaded, however, while so
much bodily strength remains: but how sad it
is to watch the increasing emaciation, and witness
the gradual decay of one who is dear to
your affections! You never saw a character so
changed, or rather so developed under a new
aspect, as that of our uncle. All appearance of
harshness has subsided, every semblance of suspicion
has given place to the kindest expression
of trust and affection. The effects are painful
as they are pleasing, as in learning to love we
are taught to fear; and dread to lose what we
have so lately known how to estimate in all its
excellence.</p>

<p>In considering him, he suggests the analogy of
a fine instrument of music that had been consigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to the cobwebs of neglect by the rude
hands of some ferocious banditti, who, in their
barbarous attempts to draw forth harmony, which
refused to flow for them, crushed the sound-board
and tore the strings, then flung the sweet cremona
to the crowd, who knew nothing of its worth.
Falling at length into the possession of one
whose delicate ear recognizes its full perfections,
the structure is repaired, the strings are tuned
anew; and now the liquid tones are poured
with generous freedom, to repay that skilful
touch, that refined taste, which alone has
power to unlock all its stores of melody. Such
a musician is my mother, and the attachment
with which she has inspired my uncle, is reflected
on us all. Of you also dear Arthur he
speaks as he ought to do; and I have pleasure in
thinking, that when we meet, you will be loved by
him, as you deserve to be by all who know you.
Another grief is, that <i>Domine</i> is not to accompany
us. His enthusiasm in pursuit of knowledge,
and the abundant store which he already
possesses, so peculiarly qualify him for travelling
with delight to himself and benefit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
others, that it is cruelly vexatious to go without
him. To see his younger brother also, to
whom he is attached with paternal tenderness,
would be a great indulgence. Yet all this he
<i>insists</i> on relinquishing, well aware, though my
mother did not utter a syllable on the subject,
that her mind was suffering a martyrdom at the
idea of leaving Lawrence and all her poor people
without some hostage in their hands, to give
security of return, supply a channel of communication,
disburse her weekly bounties, and watch
over the old, the sick, the helpless, and forlorn.
Even the assurance that Mr. Oliphant will remain
at Glenalta, which is hailed as a blessing
by the people, cannot prevent the bitterness of
their lamentations; and these have such an
effect in depressing the spirits of our little party,
that I long till we are absolutely <i>under weigh</i>;
I will not write again till we reach our journey’s
end, as you may easily suppose how completely
I shall be occupied in the interim.</p>

<p>The sisters will depend on me for shewing
them every thing worth seeing as we go along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and I must try and not disappoint their expectations
of my skill in quality of <i>cicerone</i>. Adieu.
All unite in loves.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Douglas to Miss Sandford.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">Dearest Julia,</p>

<p>Here is my last letter from Glenalta, but as
I promised to <i>stake the course</i> for you from hence
to Turin, you may expect short notices at least
from every resting place, and thus be enabled, as
you affectionately wish, to enter into all the feelings
of your friends, as they proceed in a journey
which would be such unmixed happiness in
prospect, were we not leaving sorrowful hearts
behind, and taking with us a beloved relation
whose fading form presents continual comment
on the vanity of human joys.</p>

<p>I look upon my dear uncle’s expressive countenance,
and sometimes fix my thoughts so intently
on the world of spirits, while I contemplate
the mild intelligence of that deep-sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
eye, that I lose all idea of an earthly travel, and
could fancy that he is setting out upon a heaven-ward
pilgrimage, in which it is graciously
permitted us to be the companions of his way.</p>

<p>In some sort surely, this reverie is not the
work of mere imagination; for that he is not
long for this world I begin to believe. That
he is destined for communion with the just
made perfect in another, I cannot doubt.</p>

<p>He has an angel to pilot his progress, and in
all things he obeys that voice which calls upon
him to follow in the only path that leads to a
life of immortal blessedness. Mamma is for
ever employed in reading to, and conversing
with him; and it is impossible to conceive any
thing more interesting than the dialogues to
which I am sometimes a listener.</p>

<p>We are to go to Marsden before we set out
on our tour. My uncle wishes to see the place
which he calls <i>home</i>&mdash;a word which fills me with
melancholy when he pronounces it. Alas! I
fear that Marsden will not be long a home to
him; but some repose will be required before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he proceeds on his journey. I think that we
are to sail from Southampton, and travel through
Normandy to Paris, which my uncle insists on
our seeing before we take up our abode at
Turin. My mind is at present in such a state
of agitation, that I scarcely know how to define
the emotions which are in continual conflict, at
one moment presenting nothing but images of
grief, and in the next exhibiting bright hope
and trust, with all the airy train of “pleasures
yet untried.” If I could take Glenalta, and all
the dear <i>Penates</i> that I must leave behind; but
if, and if, would lead us into labyrinths which
I must not enter, or perhaps I might feel not
satisfied with dislodging this little valley, but
increasing in my demands, might pray that the
kingdom of Kerry, <i>perhaps</i> the whole of Ireland
might accompany me; and improved as
are the powers of accommodation by the magical
working of steam, I question the capacity
of any packet, on any construction, to transport
the hundredth part of those objects which
my troublesome affections would have ever present,
were such things possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Fairies are out of date, and we must be resigned.
Worthy Mr. Bentley takes the approaching
departure of my uncle so much to
heart, that I shall not be surprised if Mount
Prospect, like Birnam Wood, should put itself
in march, and come to Turin instead of Dunsinane.
Mrs. Fitzroy used to be very entertaining
in her attacks on our good friend Mr.
Bentley, and asked him one day, when he had
said something that provoked her, what could
possess him to give such a name to his place;
adding, “I assure you, Mr. Bentley, that <i>sort</i>
of name is quite generic; it marks a class so
decidedly that I could not be mistaken in
peopling a Mount Prospect, a Bettyville, or
O’Sullivan’s Lodge, with exactly appropriate
inhabitants, and such as I do not imagine that
you would like to acknowledge for your relations.”</p>

<p>Our neighbour comically replied, “Madam,
if what you say be true, a name is of more importance
than I thought, and I feel less inclined
than ever to part with that which has the
power of conjuring up to your view my grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
honest Roger Bentley, who named the
farm which I inhabit Mount Prospect. No,
Madam, fond as I am of my ancestors, though
they were neither possessed of rank or fortune,
I should be ashamed, if, instead of being sheltered
by a solid <i>lump</i> of a house fit for our climate,
I was perched upon the top of a hill in
some fine Italian edifice, spread out with corridors,
supported on piazzas, and looking as if it
had been blown, by contrary winds, like a tropical
bird, into our bogs by accident. Your
Tivolis, Valambrosas, and Rialtas are capital
absurdities, Madam; and I should blush were I
obliged by filial respect to defend them; but,
thank God, <i>my</i> parents were plain worthy people,
who built a snug square house, and called
it Mount Prospect.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy told him that the wings, colonnades,
and transalpine nomenclature, were as ridiculous
in her eyes as in his, “but,” added she,
“I find you very ready to inveigh against one
class of follies, while you are all clemency towards
others; and as to the names of your country
seats in Ireland, they are quite a reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to you as a nation. If I hear that I am going
to visit at <i>Oakpark</i>, I am certain that I shall
see a desert moor, with a few ten-year old elms,
thinly scattered, and paled in with hurdles, to
prevent the sheep from barking them. If I am to
call at <i>Hazlewood</i>, I am equally sure to find no
wood at all, or at most an old hawthorn bush in
solitary abstraction. <i>Hollybrook</i> has, I am convinced,
neither brook nor holly near it. <i>Rockview</i>
has, probably, not a stone larger than an
orange to be seen within its precincts; and so on
of a thousand other misnomers that I could
enumerate.”</p>

<p>I remember that Mr. Bentley was <i>rising</i> in
choler, as he felt <i>lowered</i> from not being ready
at reply; but dear Domine flew to the rescue,
and seeing the commotion of our worthy friend,
he brought him off with a sort of triumph, by
assuring Mrs. Fitzroy that oaks <i>had</i> stood where
now there are only the ghosts of these forest
kings; that rocks <i>had</i> been where now the
quarryman’s pick-axe has left a level plain; that
brooks, which meandered once, are now dry;
and that our names are often remnants of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
former, not indications of our present pride. I
forget how the conversation ended, but it
amused me at the time that it happened, and
slipped out of my recollection, till having written
Mount Prospect, that name revived the
remembrance of a combat which diverted us.</p>

<p>I shall pity George Bentley, when he loses
so many friends with whom he is accustomed to
pass a part of almost every day, but he will
bear it better than Frederick would do in the
same situation. How wonderfully the good and
evil of life are balanced! Sensibility increases
every pleasure, but as certainly augments every
pain. George seems always to enjoy a sort of
calm tranquillity, which generally defends him
from any species of excitement. Is he happier
than those of more sensitive structure? perhaps
about the same. He gains on the one
side what he loses on the other. He is an excellent
young man, but he wants light and
shade, that is, he wants variety. Characters,
like countries, may be too little diversified, and
in the midst of the highest cultivation, I should
sigh for the sweet glens, and bowery labyrinths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that lie in retreat, and offer their refreshing
charms to those alone who love to seek their
deep recesses. We hear from Arthur frequently,
and I grieve to tell you that his letters bring us
sad accounts of the Craytons. Mr. Otway, I
believe, has made an effort to obtain some
money from my uncle, but with what success I
know not; however I greatly fear that no
moderate sum would be of more than temporary
use, for Lord C. is a determined gambler, and
poor Adelaide has plunged into every sort of
extravagance without supplies adequate to sustain
it. Dear Arthur’s anxiety is corroding his
spring time of life; and my poor aunt, I am
told, is not lightening his uneasiness. These
are gloomy subjects, and I will release my dearest
Julia from their melancholy influence.&mdash;Adieu
dear friend,</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="smcap">From the Same to the Same.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Marsden.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dearest Julia,</p>

<p>Here we are, and my letters have so punctually
informed you of each stage in our journey,
that I resolved on arriving at this beautiful
place to look about me, and grant a respite to
my pen, ere I gave you an account of Marsden
and its surrounding scenery. The mere fact of
our arrival was mentioned by mamma to your
dear aunt; and at the distance of a fortnight
from the short letter which conveyed that intelligence
to our beloved friends at Checkley, I
gladly resume my office of journalist, recommencing
my task with the delightful news that
my uncle is a great deal better than when we
first reached this house. The symptoms of his
disorder, at <i>least</i>, appear to be suspended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it is impossible not to yield, in some measure,
to the sweet persuasions of hope. Mamma
shakes her head, and, though she will not repress
our joyful anticipations, I perceive with
pain that <i>we</i>, the young and inexperienced,
make no impression on her mind, when we
endeavour to gain her over to our own bright
visions of recovery. Whether it be the change
of air, the novelty of the scene, or that we are
naturally inclined to feel a particular interest in
whatever is our <i>own</i>, I will not pretend to determine;
but certain it is, that from some happy
cause my dear uncle is apparently much invigorated,
and seems to enjoy life doubly himself,
since he has come to a place where he is the
immediate dispenser of pleasure to all around
him. His desire to see us gratified, stimulates
every action; and we are obliged to suppress,
with care, every half-formed wish, lest he
should be led into more exertion to indulge our
curiosity than is good for him. Julia, you bid
me tell you <i>truly</i> how I like your noble country,
and you tell me also to employ the same candour
in describing my feelings respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
people with whom I meet. Fortunately for me
you were born in Ireland, though all your early
associations are English, and therefore I feel
bold in taking some liberties with this country,
which all your encouragement could not induce
me to venture upon, were it your actual birthplace.
The beauty of England indeed I admit,
without any drawback, and if I confess that I
love my own hills and vallies better, such predilection
is easily resolvable into affections
which may often bestow pre-eminence where it
is intrinsically wanting, and raise the barren
wild without depressing the cultured garden.
This kingdom with which I was only acquainted
before as a child, and which therefore possesses
all the charms of novelty in addition to its other
attractions, in my eyes appears a perfect paradise,
so rich, so cultivated is every part of it;
and if I sometimes long for a tangled dell like
that of the “Retreat,” I am bound in honesty
to confess what an extent of cheerless waste I
must travel over, ere I could be indulged by a
sight of its soft shades again.</p>

<p><i>Here</i> then there is a fair <i>set-off</i> which squares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
accounts; but I come now to the <i>people</i>, who
bold the same relation, in every country, with
the land which they inhabit that the kernel of a
nut bears to the shell; and here I unhesitatingly
declare my preference for the Irish character
beyond any specimens which I have as yet met
with in English society, provided always that
you suppose me to compare people of education
with each other. If you <i>descend</i> in the scale,
the balance is greatly in favour of the English,
whose trading and yeomen classes exhibit patterns
which I wish my countrymen would copy;
but in the extreme of the series we Hibernians
hold up our heads again, and though our peasants
may be, and alas are, more meanly fed,
clothed, and lodged, than the sleek sons of
Albion, there is a union of heart and intelligence
to be found in every Kerry cabin, of which I
would not give up one little grain, for all the
artificial benefits in the power of bacon and
beans to confer upon these votaries of good
cheer. Certainly, one half at least of every
Englishman amongst the lower orders must be
<i>stomach</i>, and if so, a stranger need not be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
at the unceasing anxiety expressed to
provide for the due support of such extensive
capacity; but there is more room for the exercise
of our affections, where the mere animal
range of the human economy is not the Aaron’s
rod that swallows up all the rest. The eating
and drinking <i>here</i> are quite astonishing to one
accustomed to our aërial diet; and I have no
doubt that an English <i>mind</i> is subdued by weight
of matter, as effectually as fire is smothered by
the pressure of wet sods.</p>

<p>There is something so beneath the dignity of
human kind, when compared with the inferior
creation, in submitting thus entirely to <i>animal</i>
control, and being only the thing which a full
or scanty meal may determine, that, much as
I desire to behold some amelioration of my
dear Paddy’s lot, I hope I shall never live to
see his bright imagination quenched in ale, nor
his light heels fettered by the leaden influence
of over-feeding on beef and pork.</p>

<p>But to return to Marsden (which, though
sold from the caprice of its former possessor
for £50,000, is said to be worth double that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sum), it seems to me a fit residence for a
prince. We have a splendid house, magnificent
grounds, hot-houses, conservatories, and
all the long line of fine and handsome appendages
to rank and fortune, for which I have
made the discovery, that I possess no taste,
unless upon the quiet scale of Glenalta, where,
by the bye, we have just as good and as pretty
things in the fruit and flower way as any situation
can boast. The views from Marsden are
superb, and on a clear day command an immense
extent.</p>

<p>We have had crowds of visitors coming to
pay their compliments to my uncle, who has
the reputation of being enormously rich; and
whether it be that there is really nothing to
interest in the character of our neighbourhood,
or that the heartlessness of an acquaintance
formed on the ground of mere wealth, has nothing
congenial with my disposition in the nature
of its cement, I perhaps ought not to determine
too hastily; but though we have seen
a great many people, I have not as yet met
with any who has left on my mind a distinct impression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I had often heard that the English
are reserved, and I expected to find them silent.
This is not the case as far as my experience
extends; but were I to furnish a motto for the
talkers who have fallen in my way, it should
be “<i>beaucoup parler et rien dire</i>.” To be sure
we have come at a bad time, for we are in the
midst of an election for the county, which occupies
every creature, rich and poor, to the exclusion
of every topic unconnected with itself;
and yet, though I have tried to interest myself
in that which engages the attention of all,
down to the little children who have got party
badges for play-things, and have learned to
shout for the candidates to which they severally
belong, I have not heard a single syllable in
which a stranger could sympathize&mdash;not a
word of parliamentary fitness&mdash;no mention of
head or heart that could induce one to hope for
this one or the other amongst the combatants.
I am sick of the sounds, “weight of influence,
county men, borough interests, large
estates, numerous tenantry,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>My uncle has made a point of our accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
several invitations, though he is not able to dine
out himself; and the only pleasure which I derive
from compliance with his wishes in this
matter, is found in the amusement which our
remarks afford to this dear and pleasant host,
who would be a gem in society himself were
bodily weakness not to impede the flow of a
mind replete with sense and information. To
enjoy at <i>home</i> the conversation of three such
beings as mamma, Mr. Otway, and my uncle,
has the effect perhaps of making me fastidious;
but the goddess of dulness seems to have taken
under her especial care every dinner-party in
which I have been forced to mingle since I came
into Hampshire. While we are in the drawing-room
there is an attempt sometimes made to
take <i>us</i> into the circle, which would be very diverting
to witness as a mere looker on, but
which is very fatiguing to those who must reply.
There is a certain activity of manner, apparently
quite distinct from natural good spirits,
which seems to be the fashion at present
amongst the young people of my own sex; and
they assail me with an incessant <i>giggle</i>, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a running accompaniment to the silliest, most
objectless questions about Ireland, as if it were a
kingdom in the moon. One tells me that she
wonders I do not speak with a brogue; another
asks whether there are public amusements
in <i>Dublin</i>, a third inquires whether “the castle”
is really a castle or not, and before it is possible
to answer, hops off to something else; a fourth
absolutely entreated me to tell her whether
there were not still existing in the remoter parts
of the island, a few of the aboriginal wild Irish
with wings, and laughed immoderately at her
own wit. All these flat stupidities are uttered
with an air of hilarity so perfectly uncalled for,
by the occasion, that it makes me stare. If the
object be to proclaim that the spirits never flag,
the method is <i>round-about</i>, only proving the
fact by implication that <i>if</i> people can laugh
<i>without</i> reason, they must, by an irresistible argument,
be supposed capable of excitement when
any cause of merriment appears.</p>

<p>From girls of my own age I have flown to
the matrons, in hope of some relief from “lively
dulness which ever loves a joke;” and so far I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have not been disappointed, that in joining
the elder groups I have found <i>rest</i>, because, not
being prepared to enter upon the subjects which
they discussed, I have quietly sat by, recovering
my spirits while they talked of their nurseries,
indispositions, and all the births, marriages, and
deaths, past, present, and to come, of the whole
county.</p>

<p>As mamma never leaves my uncle, she is
spared much weariness of mind, which would
not be counterpoised to her by the novelty which
makes some amends to us, the younger branches
of the household. Mr. Otway performs the
part of <i>Chaperone</i>; and on our return home we
find the cords of affection more tightly drawn
towards that delightful society with which heaven,
in its bounteous mercy has blessed our
happy fire-side. It is, however, only doing
justice to inform you, that we have not yet seen
some charming people who are reported to inhabit
this vicinity. One family is in France,
and two others, who are I am told really worth
knowing, are prevented from coming to see us
by domestic affliction. You are to take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
saucy criticisms, then, with due allowance, and
not conclude me to be an indiscriminating
bigot, who finds fault with all things exterior
to her own particular pale. With this qualification
I will continue my comments, and
venture to express a wonder, that where wealth
and situation lead us to expect good breeding,
there should be such a deficiency of it as to exclude
from conversation all who are not intimate
through locality with a petty circle of subjects
that possess no general interest, and are incapable
of eliciting any one observation in which a
stranger can participate. How <i>can</i> people fancy
themselves agreeable while they are telling the
minutest particulars of a teething fit, or <i>cackling</i>
over an interminable list of weddings and wedding
wardrobes? Amongst the gentlemen, the
<i>elders</i> devote to prophecying upon the probable
effects of the present drought, all their
mental powers which are not absorbed by the
election, and amongst the more youthful there
is the most deplorable lack of intellect in all
that I have heard them say to each other,
while to the <i>female</i> part of their acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
nothing can exceed the inanity of their addresses:
“Were you at the flower-shew?”
“Shall you go to the race-balls?” “Do you
ride?” “Do you like rowing?” are the only
sounds that live upon my memory, and the
above questions have been asked to Charlotte
and me so repeatedly, that we might almost be
excused if, like Dr. Franklin on entering an
American town, to save the trouble of inquiry,
we were to set up a little placard answering
in large letters, Yes or No, to these and some
similar interrogatories, under a supposition that
they will be proposed anew at every turn of the
street. It is sometimes almost ludicrous to see
a young man suddenly start from long forgetfulness
that a lady was sitting on one side while he
had been discussing the merits, perhaps of a
fishing-fly on the other; and turning rapidly
round, propose some interrogation quite unconnected
with what he had uttered the moment
before. This division of topics into male and
female genders is very unlike what I have been
accustomed to, and strikes me as a marked
difference between English and Irish society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
by no means favourable to the former. We
were the day before yesterday at a great dinner,
and I sat next to a Mr. Johnson, who is eldest
son to a baronet of large fortune in this neighbourhood.
So long a time had elapsed before
he condescended to speak to me, that I had
hopes of being entirely forgotten, which, however
mortifying to my <i>pride</i>, was compensated
by the kindness of a <i>nice crisp</i> little elderly
gentleman on my left hand, who, with great
goodnature, talked to me of his crops in such a
manner as to make me feel that he thought himself
conversing with a rational creature, capable
of estimating the signs of the times, and
understanding the difference between wheat and
barley, turnips and mangel worsel. But though
Mr. Johnson had sat during half an hour with
his back turned upon me while he was talking
over, in horrible detail, a pugilistic match
fought near Portsmouth a few days ago, the
movement of my head in bowing to some one
who had asked me to drink wine, brought me
in a flash of recollection to his mind, and I
could scarcely preserve my gravity, when, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lightning, he <i>whisked</i> round, and said, as if for a
wager, it was so rapidly done, “Do you waltz?”
I feared that this was a beginning which augured
a long list of balls, respecting which I should
have the humiliating confession to make that I
had not been at one in my life; but I was
spared this lowering avowal as the entire notice
which he took of the simple negative with
which I replied was contained in the monosyllable
“<i>Oh</i>,” which, by the bye, is the most
comprehensive little word except <i>nice</i> in the
colloquial intercourse of England; and from
the variety of meaning which the several intonations
of voice with which it is pronounced,
are capable of imparting, assumes as wide a
range of interpretation as the “Spectator”
allots to the exercise of the fan. There is the
<i>oh</i>, inquiring; the <i>oh</i>, surprised; the <i>oh</i>, satisfied;
the <i>oh</i>, contemptuous; the <i>oh</i>, affected;
the <i>oh</i>, languid; the <i>oh</i>, inquisitive; the <i>oh</i>,
doubtful; in short, there is scarcely a state of
the mind which an English provincialist cannot
contrive to convey by a correct modulation of
the many keys upon which may be played <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>those
two letters; and as for the twin-brother
of this <i>multum in parvo</i>&mdash;<i>nice</i>, I heard it on one
day lately, applied to Lord Eldon, who, a lady
near me, said, was a “nice chancellor.” Afterwards
to the French nation, who, a gentleman
opposite, declared, are the nicest people in the
world; then to Der Freischütz, Miss Stephens,
a calve’s head, wild ducks, the Hampshire breed
of pigs, red Lammas wheat, Cheshire cheese,
cream, coffee, and the Courier! Does <i>nice</i>
mean <i>any</i>, or <i>every</i> thing?</p>

<p>An old gentleman called here this morning,
who amused me so much by a dry good
humour, which brought Mr. Bentley, and
visions of my beloved Glenalta to memory,
that I long to be better acquainted with him.
I owe him my gratitude also for entering the
lists most gallantly, in quality of my defender,
and saying for me, to that tiresome Mr. Johnson,
whom I have already introduced to you,
what I never could have said for myself. They
entered the library together, and found me
reading the newspapers to my uncle, who, on
perceiving that I was going to make my escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gently restrained my movement by laying his
hand on my arm, and desiring that I should
stay and help him to entertain his visitors.
When they came in, and the usual comments
on the weather and state of the roads were
ended, the old gentleman appeared occupied in
conversation with my uncle, when the young
one turned round to me, and taking up the
paper which I had laid down, with that self-sufficient
air of conscious superiority which so
many young men ridiculously assume, and in a
tone which implied as much contempt as indifference
would permit him to express, drawled
out “Pray, Miss Douglas, are you a politician?”
I knew not what to say, and I suppose
looked as foolish as I felt, which old
Mr. Bolton appeared to observe, and with an
alacrity of kindness worthy of the chivalrous
ages, he made an answer for me, which, if it
did not <i>satisfy</i>, at least silenced the enquirer.
“I hope that Miss Douglas takes pleasure in
reading the newspapers,” said my knight,
“newspapers contain the history of the present
time, and while that of the past is read by all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
who do not desire to be branded for their ignorance
(here he cast a sidelong glance at the
younger visitor), I see no reason why a lady
should disdain useful knowledge, because it is
not <i>yet</i> presented to her in the form of a <i>book</i>;”
then changing the subject, before I had power
to speak, he added, “But, Miss Douglas, pray
tell me how you like Hampshire, and what you
think of John Bull, who, I am afraid, seems a
rude sort of animal in your eyes?”</p>

<p>This was said so gaily, that I did not suffer
the least confusion, and resolving that I would
not bring discredit by my <i>niaiserie</i> on dear
Ireland, I took courage, and replied, that
Hampshire was beautiful, and when the <i>election</i>
was over I would tell him how I liked the
inhabitants, as <i>then</i> I might hope to become
acquainted with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton laughed heartily, and answered
with the pleasantest animation, “Be assured,
my dear young lady, that the election which
you deprecate, is a better friend than you think,
and saves you from the fancy-ring and white
mustard-seed, which are the favourite topics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that have succeeded the Catholic question just
<i>gone by</i>. Now I conceive, from your countenance,
that you would not like the pugilistic
platform better than the hustings, nor find the
stomach a more interesting subject of conversation
than the <i>poll</i>: what say you?”</p>

<p>I was delighted with my champion, and told
him merrily that he was very right, and I would
take care how I repined again.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” continued he, “that you, who
seem to have been brought up in the school of
nature and reason, have little idea how widely
what is called the world, departs from both. It
is not enough now-a-days to furnish your house,
and adorn your person according to a received
rule, you must eat, drink, sleep, think, or not
think, fashionably. You must be of one consent
in sickness as in health; if indisposed, you
must be <i>fashionably</i> indisposed, and as fashionably
cured. Four or five years ago every body
of any pretension was afflicted by determination
of blood to the head, and hence, lancet,
leeches, and cupping, were in wonderful activity.
The head is now entirely out of fashion, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
amongst the dandies and phrenologists, and the
stomach takes precedence of every other topic,
in a well organized society. As you are young,
and have not perhaps made your <i>debut</i>, I will
give you a hint or two to prepare you for <i>good
company</i>. Young ladies of your age, play,
sing, waltz, and dress; talk of Der Freischütz,
Weber, and Pasta; laugh a great deal when
there is nothing to laugh at, which shews ability,
for <i>any</i> one could be merry if a <i>subject</i> were
allowed, and are silly, envious, and unfeeling
<i>ad libitum</i>. Young gentlemen of my friend
Mr. Johnson’s age, ride, fight, row, play whist,
hunt, fish, shoot, and talk nonsense; occasionally
dancing and flirting, as the necessity of
circumstances may require; but by no means
spoiling your sex, by paying any of those polite
attentions which might lead to insubordination,
the more alarming, as were your masters to lose
any thing of their presumed superiority, they
might be ill prepared to recover the lapse of
power, unless by a barbarous appeal to physical
strength. The <i>matron</i> class you will find as
well as the well-bred men of a <i>certain standing</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
eating mutton chops, at intervals, to the amount
of a certain number of ounces, with which no
mixture of liquid is permitted, from eight
o’clock in the morning till the same hour in the
evening. You will see them likewise swallowing
white mustard-seed by wholesale, and swearing
to its sovereign efficacy in every possible
disorder of the human frame. It will naturally
suggest itself to you, that any demand upon
the <i>brains</i> would be unreasonable, now that the
casket which contains them is less carefully
attended to than before, and therefore, as an
act of justice, fashion very equitably dispenses
altogether with the presence of intellect, which
is enjoying a long vacation.”</p>

<p>I love this old man for his good humour and
good sense; and, more than for either, because
his sallies excessively diverted the invalid left in
my charge by the rest of the party, who had gone
to return a visit at some distance from Marsden,
and who came back before Mr. Bolton had
taken his departure.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson went first, and when he had
made his bow, my uncle asked whether his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Sir Thomas Johnson, were not a very rich
man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Bolton, “he is <i>called</i> by
courtesy a rich man. He has an immense extent
of property, which gives him considerable
influence; but he is so <i>poor</i>, notwithstanding,
that he cannot command a hundred pounds in
ready money, while he is governed by such an
inordinate pride that he would rather die than
shorten his rental by an inch of paper, in selling
off land enough to pay the charges on his estate.
He is, however, a kind hearted, hospitable man,
who married late in life, and thinks his only
child, who has just been paying his respects to
you, a <i>sans pareil</i>, whose hand will amply recompense
the largest sacrifice of fortune that
can be made to attain it. It is now his great
object in life to marry his son, and, though he
idolizes pedigree, he thinks his own so transcendent
that it will ennoble any inferior race;
for which reason he gives it to be understood
that family is less an object with him than
wealth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“And pray,” said my uncle, “what sort of
young man is Mr. Johnson?”</p>

<p>“Empty, pompous, and good-natured,” answered
Mr. Bolton. “He has walked so many
years up and down a long gallery of portraits,
that he honestly believes ‘the boast of heraldry’
to belong peculiarly to his house. As he was
never sent to school, he had no opportunity of
comparing himself with his superiors, and was
not compelled to find his true level by the discipline
of a <i>fagging</i> system, or the aristocracy of
rank. A private tutor indulged his early indolence;
toad-eaters and retainers flattered his
youthful vanity; and a short stay at Oxford has
put the finish to his education by sending him
home an accomplished boxer, rower, and judge
of champagne. He is, as may naturally be expected,
very extravagant, and such a darling
with his parents, that, notwithstanding the difficulty
of raising supplies, no curb has ever been
put upon his expenditure.”</p>

<p>“Then,” observed my uncle, “I suppose that
he is <i>himself</i> also looking after a wife.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” answered Mr. Bolton, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I have no doubt is certain of success wherever
he may fix his attention.”</p>

<p>I could not help thinking how little I should
envy the future Lady Johnson, whoever she
might be, but the conversation was interrupted
here by mamma’s return; and in a few minutes
Mr. Bolton took his leave.</p>

<p>I have written a long letter, but I know that
you are interested in all that we say and do, so I
need never apologize for being minute in my
details. My uncle has some business to do
which will detain him here for some weeks
longer, and I shall hope to hear from you and
write again before we sail for France.</p>

<p>Well, though we are here in the midst of all
that is beautiful and luxurious, my heart pines
after Glenalta, and I dream continually of the
scene at parting from so many dear objects that
we left behind. Switzerland, however, will
charm me I am sure, and I promise myself a
rich feast in those Alpine wilds which we are to
visit. How astonishing to me is the preference
which I often hear expressed for the artificial
world over that of nature! Not all the splendour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of this fine place could ever win me from
the dear heathy mountains of Kerry. Fine
things do not warm my heart, nor captivate my
imagination; and I never find myself coveting
my neighbours’ goods as I pass through the
sumptuous dwellings that surround us here.
All <i>my</i> violations of the tenth commandment are
kept for an humbler scale of beauty, but one far
more interesting in my view of the matter.</p>

<p>The sisters unite in kindest love; and now,
dearest Julia, farewell.</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Emily Douglas</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2>LETTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Ed. Otway, Esq. to Rev. Mr. Oliphant.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Marsden.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear and excellent Friend,</p>

<p>I begin my letter with news which, if it convey
to you in any proportion the pleasure which
its announcement imparts to me, may well be
called cheering intelligence. From the time that
General Douglas heard of our late rector’s illness,
he was anxious to procure the succession of that
parish, in which Glenalta stands, for you; but
doubtful of his power to accomplish the end in
view, he begged that you might not be informed
of his design. Last night’s post put us in possession
at the same moment of the papers which
mention Mr. Green’s death, and a letter stating
the agreeable information that all difficulties
in the way to your preferment are smoothed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the general’s promise to provide for a young person,
by the gift of a small living, of which he has
the advowson, in this country. The joy of this
little circle is quite vociferous. Your young
friends have not slept, I believe, since the glad
tidings were communicated; and would gladly
resign the happiness of travelling into new scenes,
for the gratification of helping to make the bonfires
which they think will redden the horizon in
token of good will upon the present occasion.
I heard Fanny telling her brother this morning
that she had no doubt St. John’s Eve never presented
such a blaze upon the Beacon Hill, as
your appointment will kindle. This is a bold
prophecy, but she stakes her credit on the justness
of her prediction.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Oliphant, I have a request to
make, which you will not refuse. The glebe
house wants a library to make it comfortable.
I enclose you a draught for £500, and desire
that, by the time of my return, I may find you
in possession of a room in which you can write
your sermons, and pore over your <i>Elzevirs</i> in all
the quiet of abstraction from household cares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Poor Mrs. Green and her children will be desirous
to leave their present abode, I dare say;
and you will oblige me by requesting them, in
my name, to make use of Lisfarne, as an asylum,
while it may suit their convenience. When they
have evacuated your new premises, desire
Barnes, my steward, to send trees, shrubs, and
plants, of whatever kind you may want, to furnish
your garden and shrubbery.</p>

<p>And now I must tell you an anecdote of your
friend Frederick, which will delight your heart.
His uncle, who wins hourly upon our affections,
alarmed us a few days ago by a fainting fit,
which seemed to threaten sudden dissolution,
but before the arrival of a physician, for whom
we sent to the next town, his sister’s skill had
brought him back to life, and his eyes opened on
a group of such tender and genuine mourners,
as must have gratified the best feelings of his
breast. For a day or two Dr. Pancras looked
grave, and paused in giving his opinion; but the
dear general has rallied considerably, and
wishes to hasten his departure.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening Mr. Peltry, the solicitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
reached Marsden from town, bringing with him
the title deeds of this place, and some other
papers of consequence. On the following day,
after breakfast, my valued friend sent for me to
his study, desiring that Frederick should join
us immediately. As soon as we were together
he took his nephew by the hand and said, “My
dear boy, I have sent to London for the gentleman
who arrived last night, in order that I may
legally dispose of my property, and provide for
some who are dear to me before ‘I go hence,
and am no more seen.’ I intend Marsden for
you, and wish that this kind guardian (turning
his eyes upon me), who has aided your beloved
mother in the task which she has so admirably
performed, should be witness to my purposes.
There is but one condition which I desire to
propose in leaving Marsden to you. It is that
you should all live here during the next five
years, or till the marriage of your sisters may
naturally occasion a dispersion of the family.
After this trial, which will be of sufficient length
to ascertain the <i>wishes</i> of each individual, if you
should prefer Ireland to England, you are at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
liberty to bring this place to the hammer. I
bought it myself; it is no hereditary possession.
I shall soon leave it, and should inflict rather
than confer a kindness were I to impose a restriction
on your inclinations that might have
the effect of converting what I mean to be a
benefit into a burthen.”</p>

<p>Frederick, whose face had expressed every variety
and gradation of feeling which such an
address was calculated to inspire in a breast
which is the abode of all that is most noble, and
most tenderly affectionate, could restrain his
emotion no longer. He pressed his uncle’s
pale hand to his lips with ardour, and bathed
it with tears of honest grief and affection. My
poor friend was deeply agitated, which his nephew
perceiving, he struggled with his own
feelings to avoid exciting those of the invalid;
and, making an effort, thanked his benefactor
with that warm yet dignified expression of countenance
and manner, which, while it bespoke
the vividness of gratitude, betrayed no symptom
whatsoever of joy in the mere acquisition
of fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now then, we will call in Mr. Peltry, and
you may go, my dear Frederick,” said the general.</p>

<p>“Oh not yet,” replied the generous youth.
“Do not banish me for a little while; I have
an earnest request to make, and only hesitate
lest you, my dear uncle, should think me for a
moment, either ungrateful or presumptuous.”</p>

<p>“I cannot think you either,” answered General
Douglas; “proceed, tell me what you
would have, and if I can, I will indulge you.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me then,” said Frederick, “if I
speak all that is on my heart. I say nothing to
deter you from making a final disposition of
your property, because every man must feel a
weight of anxiety taken from his mind when he
has performed an act by which he provides for
the future interest of those who are dear to him.
Such an act, far from shortening his days, is
likely to prolong them, by removing a painful
pressure from his mind; and therefore I shall
have pleasure in thinking that this deed is done,
as well as in being thought worthy of mention
in it. But, dearest uncle, a slight remembrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in point of vulgar estimation may be rendered
supremely valuable by the manner of bestowing
it, and should I survive you, any mark of your
affection will be preserved with love and veneration
while I live. May I then, without
dread of offending, by the appearance of dictating
to your better judgment, suggest Arthur
Howard as a fitter representative of your fortune
than I am. He is a noble fellow; and by
the disinterestedness of his conduct, likely to be
reduced from high expectations to almost abject
poverty. He is at this moment raising money to
keep his brother-in-law, Lord Crayton, out of
jail, and prevent the effects of such event upon
his mother’s shattered nerves. I, on the contrary,
have been educated with the view to improving
my patrimony by professional labour, the idea
of which is not at all displeasing to me; and I
frankly own that the love of my native soil is so
strongly impressed upon my heart, that little
Glenalta has greater charms for me than a
ducal residence in any other place could possess.”</p>

<p>Frederick sat on the sofa by his uncle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
held his hand while he spoke. When he
paused, the general clasped him round the neck,
and concealing his tears, which were flowing
fast, by leaning his head on his nephew’s shoulder,
he exclaimed, “There I recognize the son
of Henry Douglas! Yes, Frederick, you are
worthy of the father and the mother from whom
you spring. Your fine disposition shall be indulged,
though not in exactly the manner
which you suggest. <i>You</i> shall be lord of Marsden:
but I promise you to take care of Arthur
by leaving him such a sum, as shall free his
estate from a portion, at least, of its incumbrances;
and now, dear boy, leave me; I must
not lose time, and I am anxious to see Mr. Peltry.
Say nothing, I charge you, of this conversation
to your mother and sisters, I know them
too well not to be assured that the recital of
what has passed between us, would give them
pain, and I wish to spare them every uneasiness
in my power to prevent them from suffering.”</p>

<p>Your young friend then left the room, the
solicitor was sent for, and such testamentary arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were made by this interesting being,
who has just come to make us feel the full value
of what we are about to lose, as reflect the
highest honour on his justice and impartiality.</p>

<p>We shall soon set out, and I feel a mournful
presentiment that we shall return to England a
diminished number. The progress of my poor
friend’s disease is very slow, and imperceptible,
and he has intervals of apparent improvement,
so encouraging to our hopes, that had experience
not frequently proved how delusive are
these temporary amendments, we should be led
from time to time to increase the measure of
disappointment by giving way to fallacious expectations.</p>

<p>I am summoned to attend him in an airing,
and must say adieu.</p>

<p class="center">Your faithful friend,</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Douglas to the Rev. Mr. Oliphant.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">My very dear good Friend,</p>

<p>If my pen had kept pace with my heart, my
congratulations would have reached you long
ere this; but you know me too well to doubt
their truth; and it would be equally injurious
to your confidence, and my sincerity, were I to
expend the short time I allow myself for writing,
in apologies which are unnecessary.</p>

<p>Accept my heart-felt rejoicings on your preferment,
which I consider as providential to myself.
Your task was concluded. You had
safely piloted my beloved child through his collegiate
course; and would have missed your
wonted employment, while no other sufficiently
<i>marked</i> to occupy your whole time, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
detain you henceforward at Glenalta, I dreaded
to hear that you must leave me; but wherever
duty called you would have followed her voice,
and could I have asked you to stay if conscience
disapproved the lengthened sojourn? <i>Now</i>
you <i>belong</i> to us. All the energies of your admirable
nature will be employed where your
old friends may still benefit by them. You
will continue to be our teacher and friend.
You will become our pastor, and be reverenced
and beloved by the poor, whose blessings you
have so often felt in grateful showers on your
head. I have settled in my own mind that you
will not possess a comfortable home without inviting
your worthy sister and her only child, to
share it with you; and if such be your intention,
you must permit me to assist in furnishing
your dwelling for a lady’s reception. Much as
we have been in the habit of looking up to you,
I am not <i>sure</i> that we should defer to your taste
in such a matter.</p>

<p>I write by this post to Dublin, from whence
you will receive my “bread and salt,” as the
Russians call this species of offering to a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
establishment. Oh, my dear friend, how deep
is my gratitude to the Almighty giver of good,
for the mercies I continually experience! It
would have been a great alloy to the happiness
of knowing how comfortably you are placed beyond
the reach of those sordid cares which depress
the spirit, had you owed the independence
now conferred, to a stranger. I must have
felt <i>some</i> pleasure under <i>any</i> circumstances at
your being enabled to continue that character
to which your pupils once assigned the appellation
of the “good Benefico (<i>the good giant</i>),” but your little volatile
friend Fanny, said to me a few days ago,
and reflected my own feelings as she spoke,
“Mamma, there are but two people in the
world besides you to whom I cannot <i>grudge</i> the
delight of making dear Mr. Oliphant a man of
easy fortune; and those two are my uncle and
Mr. Otway.” But this theme, all inspiring as
it is, must not make me forgetful of your request.</p>

<p>You earnestly desire to be made acquainted
as minutely as possible with the progress of my
dearly loved brother’s mind towards that heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rest, without the possession of which, the
approach of that mysterious change which awaits
all created beings, must be awful beyond description.
You know that I was fortunate in
seizing upon the character of my brother’s mind
at an early period of our acquaintance. One
of the first outlines that I took, discovered to
me his strong aversion to control, <i>even</i> in conversation.
I perceived that having been long accustomed
to exert an unrestrained free will in
the regulation of his own occupations as well as
amusements, and having also seen so much of
design in the ordinary intercourse of the world
as to make him suspicious of every formal attack
upon his opinions, he met with a sort of predetermined
opposition the slightest attempt to
alter his views, upon any subject of interest.
With this clue, I pursued my way, turning
aside from, rather than courting, any opportunity
of conversing upon topics respecting which
I burned to know his thoughts. The usual
style of our conversation was of that mixed nature
which gave me an early insight into a mind
replete with various powers. Its predominating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
tone was that of playfulness, and a common observer
might have been borne out in calling
General Douglas a humourist; but though possessed
of all the requisites to inspire mirth, as
well as taste its influence, I could see a dark
cloud gathering underneath a smile, and catch
a half breathed sigh, that wafted to my heart’s
core the sounds, “All, all is vanity&mdash;delusion
all,” when gaiety <i>seemed</i> to dance around his
heart. What would I not have given at such
moments to have seized a hand, and with affectionate
energy pressed admission to the sacred
repository of gloomy contemplation; but the
time was not come. A premature remark, however
tenderly whispered, would have alarmed a
retiring and delicate, as well as proud mind,
unaccustomed to see itself exposed to view. I
therefore waited till opportunity should naturally
invite communication; and such presented
itself ere long after my brother’s arrival amongst
us at Glenalta.</p>

<p>You may remember the time when you and
Frederick were reading Butler’s Analogy as
part of the College course. My dear boy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fond of talking over with me each chapter as he
proceeded, and I determined to read that inestimable
work anew, for the purpose of refreshing
my memory, in conversation with him. One
day, employed in this manner, I was sitting alone
in my dressing-room, when my brother tapped
at the door, saying that you wanted me for a
few minutes in the study, and asked whether he
might remain till my return, as he also wished
to speak with me. On my return, I found him
eagerly devouring the chapter on a future state;
and so absorbed was he, that at first he did not
perceive my entrance into the room. When he
did, he started, and said, “Caroline, I have to
apologize for taking up your book to see what
you were reading, and I find something that has
struck me: but I make a discovery that <i>you</i> are
fond of these dark themes. Why have you
never broached these subjects with me?” “Because,”
said I, “that they <i>are</i> both dark and
deep, and lie hidden between us and our Creator.
The controversies of men are seldom beneficial,
and more frequently excite the passions
than satisfy the pride of human presumption.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
“Do you mean, then, to say,” replied our dear
inquirer, “that religion is incapable of proof?”
“So far from it,” answered I, “that every object
in nature bears proof to demonstration of
the great leading tenets of religion; but I mean
to say, such is the perverseness of our hearts,
that we repel, when offered by another, those
arguments which we should be proud to originate
ourselves, and refuse conviction, unless our
vanity be gratified by taking some credit to itself,
at <i>least</i> in the <i>selection</i> of those reasons
which operate a change of opinion. For this
cause we suffer books to teach, though we deny
a friend the delight of converting us from the
evil of our ways, and why? Alas! in human
weakness we have the answer. The choice of a
book is a <i>free</i> act; the continuing to read it is a
<i>free</i> act. The advocacy of its doctrines, if they
be arrayed with power, talent, and genius, reflects
honour on our discrimination, and, to a
certain degree, identifies us with the author,
who perhaps has vanished from the arena of our
paltry rivalry, having been called to his account;
or, should he still be alive, is removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
immediate field of competition. I <i>know</i> these
humiliating facts experimentally, for I have
doubted, and I have been perverse.”</p>

<p>From this moment, every reserve on my brother’s
part was at an end. He looked steadfastly
in my face, with an expression which
seemed to ask, is this indeed the <i>truth</i>, and not
said to inveigle me into confidence? His own
penetration assured him that I practised no deception.
He took my hand, and spoke to the
following effect:</p>

<p>“You are the very being to whom my whole
soul shall be unfolded. Much is locked up
within my breast that ‘ferments for want of air.’
You are right; you have in a few words drawn
my picture; and <i>so</i> truly, that I now confess I
should not have acknowledged this moment the
fidelity of your portrait, had you boasted the
superiority over me, of one who had not been
drawn aside yourself from the path to which you
have returned. But though your having once
doubted, is a bond between us, like that of a
common language in a foreign land; there is
much room yet for discrepancy; and the <i>nature</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of our stumbling blocks may be so extremely
different that we may lose, rather than gain
<i>accession</i> of sympathy by attempting to travel
together in a course where so many intricate
bye-paths present themselves to distract attention
and divide our choice. Every thinking
mind which has felt what it was to be perplexed,
has been conscious of gradation in the difficulties
that embarrassed its progress: some were but
apparent, and vanished on the approach of
knowledge; others, more stubborn, required
more time and pains to conquer, but yielded at
length to the force of reason, while there are
some obstacles to Faith so harassing, that no
efforts of the understanding are of any avail in
breaking down the barriers which they present
to sincere uncompromising belief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Man never reasons but from what he knows,’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and if all attempts to comprehend, are rendered
futile by the imperfection of his faculties, it is
vain to call upon his faith. Credulity, indeed,
may receive all things; but where Heaven has
granted intellect, impalpable and unseen as are
its operations, it excludes the dogmatizing influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of arbitrary control, and will not bend
to mere authority. Tell me then, Caroline, what
chiefly puzzled you&mdash;what were the obstructions
which principally encumbered your path,
and if they resemble those which block my way.
I will next inquire how you removed them; ask
you to be my Hannibal; and prepare to follow
in that track which you shall excavate for me
through the rocky defile.”</p>

<p>I told him that after avowing the fact on
which I look back with pain, of having been
sceptically inclined in that period of youthful
arrogance when new-born reason, proud of her
first flights, imagines that her wing can soar
above the clouds, and penetrate the sanctuaries
of the Most High, I could have no objection
to inform him how far I had been enabled to
overcome, as also where my presumption met
with its first check, while Reason was my only
guide. I then gave him a brief sketch of my
former uneasy sensations, and the causes which
had led to them. He listened with the deepest
attention, and, when I concluded, answered
that by a remarkable coincidence in our views,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the only difficulties which had greatly harassed
me were precisely those which still haunted him
with ceaseless perplexity. “I never,” added
he, “stuck at the historical discordances of the
Bible, because, though I did not take the
trouble of going minutely into the inquiry myself,
I was aware that others of superior learning
did do so; and when such a man as Sir
William Jones, versed in Oriental literature,
and examining the records of antiquity with
critical acumen, was satisfied with his researches,
so as to pronounce upon the increase of evidence
which every added information produced
to him, confirmatory of Scriptural truth, I could
not tarry to believe that <i>apparent</i> contrarieties
only require investigation to be satisfactorily
reconciled to <i>my</i> understanding also, were I patiently
to pursue the testimony which might be
collected. I never felt that Herodotus was to
be set aside as a historian, because superstition
has deformed his work, and fable occasionally
obscured the truth of his narrative. Nor
have I ever doubted that Cæsar wrote the Commentaries
imputed to his pen, though Hirtius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
has added a supplement to the book. Why
then should I deny that Moses was author of
the Pentateuch, because the account of that
great lawgiver’s death and burial is supplied by
another hand; or conclude it impossible that
Joshua, the son of Nun, should have compiled
the narrative ascribed to him, in consequence of
finding a few mistakes in the arrangement of
facts, for which he was, probably, not to blame,
and which are the cause of certain unimportant
anachronisms in the story? <i>My</i> difficulties have
been of another kind, and the three points of
free-will, the soul’s separate state, and personal
identity, have been with me, as with you, the
barrier over which I have hitherto been unable
to pass. I have heard much of a Novel which
has lately appeared, and I brought it with me,
though I have not yet looked into it, feeling
how idle it is to expect argument in a <i>story</i>.”</p>

<p>I told him that I had read <i>Tremaine</i> with
great pleasure, that I thought it an excellent,
though not a faultless work, and should be
happy to go over it again with him.</p>

<p>“You must tell me first,” said he, “how you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
arrived at your present conclusions? <i>You</i> were
not in <i>need</i> of Tremaine when you read that
book.” “Tremaine,” answered I, “would have
set me <i>thinking,</i> but would not have convinced
me upon <i>all</i> the topics which he discusses, though
<i>some</i> of his reasoning is admirable. He meets
many difficult questions very ably, but to read
any author on these subjects with advantage,
the mind, if inclined to infidelity, must undergo
a process for restoring it to its neutral state;
and a few arguments of the <i>negative</i> kind are a
very necessary preparation for those of a
<i>positive</i> character.” “What are these negative
arguments?” replied my brother. The first I
told him presented itself in the form of a question,
as to the <i>spirit</i> in which I had doubted;
and a little serious self examination “landed”
me in the mortifying, but salutary assurance,
that in the <i>strength</i> of reason I had taken so
much for granted, and assumed so many arbitrary
positions on which to ground my scepticism,
that, when brought back to first principles,
I was obliged to confess the folly of my
own inconsistency, and admit that the dogmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which I laid down required proof quite as much
as those which they attempted to controvert.
Till then I had misunderstood the Scriptural
admonition to come as a little child for instruction;
and conceived that it amounted to no less
than a prohibition against the exercise of those
faculties given us for the very purpose of discriminating
between truth and falsehood. I <i>now</i>
began to comprehend that the soundest philosophy
called upon me for a total relinquishment
of my own theories in learning <i>any</i> science.
The empiric who sets up for medical skill, untaught
by the rules of art, is not in a fit state
to practice physic, nor even to become a student,
till he has got rid of preconceived notions
which militate against the best authority. Neither
is the man who thinks himself a better
lawyer than can be found in the Courts, without
having been himself educated to the bar, in
any condition to decide upon an intricate case.
To learn any human branch of knowledge, requires
that the person desirous to learn should
come in a teachable state to the task, and not
inflated with the vain idea of being already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
capable of communicating instruction. What
more is demanded of us in the commencement
of our religious course, than we see to be but
reasonable in undertaking any earthly enterprize?
And with what additional force does
the injunction to prepare by an humble spirit
for the reception of divine knowledge apply to
the understanding, when we reflect on our utter
inability to search into the counsels of God
with our finite powers of capacity! When I
had reached this conclusion, I saw every thing
in a new light, and began to rest satisfied with
the measure of information which the Almighty
has seen fit to impart; determining no longer
to waste life in prying into the hidden things
which are not more suited to the present condition
of our intellectual strength, than the
unmitigated blaze of a meridian sun is fitted to
the structure of our visual organs. I began to
perceive the absurdity of expressions which had
passed for sound sense upon my understanding.
How often had I talked flippantly (at least
thought within my own breast) of the <i>course of
nature</i>, never recollecting that the poor Indian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
concatenation of supporters for the world, in
his list of elephants and tortoises, is not more
easily resolved into ignorance, than the arguments
by which infidelity delays the confession
that it is in utter darkness? Will the most sagacious
reasoning on the formation of a bone, by
the gradual accretion of calcareous matter;
or the most ingenious display of physiological
lore in tracing the growth of a plant from the
cotyledon up to the forest’s king, apply to the
<i>first</i> created animal, or the <i>first</i> formed oak?
There the course of nature deserts us. The
anatomist, and the naturalist, alike lay down
their arms; here they are baffled and arrested.
The former has no need of his animal laboratory
in which the chyle is separated in the process
of digestion from the daily food, and phosphate
of lime is added to the soft cartilages
that are intended to become the bony skeleton.
The latter neither requires the acorn nor the
“<i>nursing leaves</i>” to advance the oak from the
seedling to the sapling, and thence to the full-grown
monarch of the wood. He wants no gradual
process of deposition by water; no metamorphosis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
produced by fire, neither calx, nor
crystalization is demanded for the <i>primary</i>
minerals of the earth&mdash;the great “back bone” of
creation. In <i>some</i> period of time there was a
<i>beginning</i> of these things. Remove that period
indefinitely, and you may lose sight of the difficulty
in its distance from your eye, but you
cannot reduce its real dimensions; it exists in
its full size and bulk, though placed without
the range of your vision. Arrived at this
point (and driven to it you <i>must</i> be sooner or
later) you are involved in the absolute necessity
of a revelation of some sort or other, unless
you can believe that matter is self created, and
carries within itself all the power, energy, and
intelligence which we <i>know</i> that it does not
possess, or that man is a being governed entirely
by instinct, like the inferior animals, and
capable, at his first entrance into life of performing
all the functions requisite to sustain his
existence, and perpetuate its succession, as a
crow is to build its nest. <i>Neither</i> of these opinions
being tenable without a surrender of that
very experience derived through our senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which we consider as the highest possible source
of demonstration; the question which <i>next</i>
occurs is what account is there of any instruction
to the first pair who were placed in the
vast expanse of an unknown world, in which
they were to become the founders of an unborn
race of creatures? <i>Some</i> record of a matter so
vitally important to the new creation might
reasonably be expected, and we naturally look
for such. <i>One</i> narrative alone there is to satisfy
the curiosity of inquirers on this interesting
subject, and to cavil at <i>that</i> is easier than to
supply another, or give a satisfactory reason
why none whatsoever should have been preserved.
Once admit, that those things most
important <i>are</i> usually handed down in some
way or other from generation to generation,
and that it is therefore <i>probable</i> some attempt
<i>was</i> made to continue the knowledge of God’s
first intercourse with mankind to succeeding
posterity, it then remains only to try the history
which is presented to us by the rules that
we employ in every subject of human testimony.
Now, the wise and the learned declare that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
more severely they investigate, the more thoroughly
are they convinced that there is evidence
for the Bible’s having been written by the
various authors to whom the several books
which compose the Sacred Volume have been
attributed, beyond that which can be found to
substantiate the genuineness of any other work
which has ever been printed. The wise and
the learned also protest that the farther they
scrutinize into collateral testimony, the more
completely are they satisfied that these authors
recorded <i>truth</i>, and not falsehood; and that the
farther the search is carried, the more certain is
the result to corroborate the validity of Scripture.
When such gigantic minds as those of Newton,
Boyle, and Bacon, with the long list that might
be added on their side, bear evidence to this
declaration, shall we take the <i>ipse dixit</i> of a
Voltaire, a Bayle, or a Bolingbroke, who may
choose to deny, without being able to <i>prove</i>
the negative, or set up any attested credentials
to supply the place of that revelation which
they are desirous to annul? Testimony, be it
ever remembered, has no concern save with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
matters of <i>fact</i>. When human reason has
taken cognizance of all the circumstances for
or against the existence of any event which is
said to have taken place, it has done its duty,
and finished its work. With the <i>nature</i> of
such an event, it may have nothing at all to do.
If a hundred spectators, who have no motive
for collusion, declare to having seen a stone
three feet in length, and two in breadth, descend
from the clouds, and if one of these witnesses
happening to be a chemist, should report
to me its analysis, which I find to differ from
that of any stone on the surface of the earth, I
am very unphilosophical in contradicting the
possibility of an occurrence verified by so many
credible spectators, upon the simple ground of
my own ignorance. Though <i>I</i> may never have
heard of an Aërolite, such things are, and,
being a product of the atmosphere, it is not extraordinary
that its composition should differ
from that of stones produced on the earth.
Thus all my reasoning to the non-existence of
these meteoric phenomena grounded on analogy
would be fallacious, like that of the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in some Eastern climate, who laughed incredulously
when he first heard of ice, never having
himself seen water, except in a liquid state.
The <i>more</i> ignorant, the <i>less</i> are we enabled to
believe, if we measure truth by the estimate of
our understandings. So far then is scepticism
from being proof of a powerful mind, that the
reverse is oftener the fact; and every advance
which we make in knowledge and intelligence
increases the expansion of <i>faith</i>, not only by
enlarging the sphere of experience, and multiplying
those arguments of which the mind takes
advantage in examining any new matter presented
to its contemplation; but what is of
higher value, we are taught at every step a lesson
of humility by being compelled to acknowledge
the narrow limits of those abilities on
which we so arrogantly relied for scanning the
attributes of Divinity. Had the Bible <i>not</i> told
of things difficult to comprehend, I should have
wanted one direct argument in favour of its
coming from God. No scheme of merely human
invention would have baffled all human sagacity
to understand it in all its bearings, <i>unless</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
difficulty of doing so arose from <i>contradiction</i> to
reason, which is not the case. The Bible <i>tells</i>
us that it contains <i>mysteries</i> too deep for human
penetration; were such <i>discovered</i>, they would
cease to be what the word of God has declared
them; and of that word we are told that not a
tittle shall pass away. We are desired to read
and to search the Scriptures; but we are <i>not</i>
told that the utmost limit of curiosity shall be
satisfied in this world. It is vain to attempt
the Penetralia which will be shut against us,
till the soul shall awaken in the etherial regions
of a spiritual existence, disencumbered of its
“mortal coil.” Respecting <i>internal</i> evidence,
the great stress rests with me in a small compass;
I look no farther than into my own heart
to see such depravity, such continual danger of
yielding to temptation, which urges me to do
the thing which my better spirit condemns, that
I am ready to own my utter helplessness to
attain, without a guide, either happiness or
virtue. If I try the goods of this life, I am
forced to cry with Solomon that all is vanity;
pleasure but a bubble, which, glittering for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
moment, passes away; that riches, fame, rank,
power, beauty, are but gewgaws incapable of
satisfying the cravings of an immortal soul;
but even when the mind is of such mundane
temperament that these things <i>do</i> seem sufficient,
and that it would fain build its tabernacle
amongst them, Death, ‘the great teacher
Death,’ interposes to prevent the dreamer from
long enjoying the illusion of his wishes. Death
comes at last to force the unwelcome conviction
on all who will not otherwise entertain it, that
the idols of earth must inevitably be torn from
our grasp, and that the cold grave must close on
every tie which binds us to this sublunary scene.
This strong and simple truth is one of those
irresistible and universal arguments that apply
to all capacities of intellect, and to all conditions
of fortune. All shall die; all leave whatever
ministered to pride or vanity behind them.
‘A little earth that saves the world a nuisance,’
once scattered on the silent remains, the inheritance
is seized, and he who, but a week before,
lived in every tongue, descends into the narrow
house where all things are forgotten. No more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
trace exists to mark his brilliant career on earth
than lingers on the bosom of yonder ocean,
whose waves dance gladly in the sunbeams, as
if laughing at the engulphment of that majestic
sail which lately skimmed upon its surface. In
this <i>one</i> general fact there is unspeakable
reality of wretchedness&mdash;irrefragable assurance
of human nothingness&mdash;and in this solitary certainty
there is argument enough to make all
mankind, from the emperor to the beggar, ponder
on the <i>possibility</i>, if not the probability of
an hereafter. All men hate to die. They are
told that they shall <i>not</i> die, that the body
<i>only</i> shall return to its dust, and ‘the spirit to
God who gave it.’ Here is a <i>motive</i> the most
powerful, to seek, in order to believe, and if to
believe, to act as shall accord with the directions
afforded for securing a blessed immortality.
Driven by that motive I go to my Bible,
and not only discover the <i>only</i> lamp which lights
up a dark and dreary valley through which I
<i>must</i> pass, however horrible to my imagination;
but I find also, that even the most imperfect
efforts to assimilate my actions to that conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which the Scripture enjoins, the feeblest endeavours
to cultivate those tempers and affections
which the Sacred Volume enforces, are
rewarded by an inward peace which nothing
beside has power to impart; and that in proportion
as I attempt to prepare for <i>another</i>
world, I am happy in <i>this</i>, which is but its
vestibule.</p>

<p>When I had proceeded so far in my little
sketch of a “Confession of Faith,” my dear
brother said, “You prove to me, that the subjects
on which my mind has been long and
anxiously revolving, are familiar to you; and
from the little that you have said respecting
these obscure points, I anticipate much comfort
in entering more at large with you into the
field of inquiry, but remember, that <i>my</i> chief
difficulties remain untouched, and before I let
you entirely behind the scenes of my own
incertitude, I must know how you get over a
barrier which seems in my mind so insurmountable.
You must also tell me whether you are
one of those who hold <i>belief</i> to be within our
own power. If you <i>are</i>, I fear that we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
have to combat on the threshold, for I confess
nothing irritates me half so much as to be told
that I can believe if I <i>please</i>. <i>I</i> feel that my
<i>will</i> has nothing to do with my understanding.
Nay, so far from adopting the popular maxim,
that we have faith according to our <i>wishes</i>, I
find the tendency of my mind is rather to
suspect in proportion to the desire that any
proposition may be true, and, dreading disappointment,
I investigate with more precision
whatever I am most interested in hoping may
prove to be a fact, than those matters of common
occurrence, which are indifferent to me in their
consequences.”</p>

<p>I replied, that I had purposely left the topics
to which he alluded for the last. “You
desired,” said I, “to know on what shore I
had been landed, what haven of rest I have
found, after having been tempest-tossed like
yourself upon the ocean of doubt and vacillation.
I complied with your requisition, and have
told you that my bark is, I trust, safely moored
in the harbour of conviction. I will now
retrace my way, and tell you how I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
enabled to meet the tremendous questions of
free-will, spiritual immortality, and personal
identity, so far as to satisfy myself completely,
that while in the flesh it is a vain attempt to
explain them in any other way than by saying,
that they are too high, and elude mortal grasp
altogether. To know this is something, and
we arrive at the knowledge by <i>means</i> of reason,
it is doubly satisfactory. Whether <i>my</i> reasoning
will carry any weight to <i>your</i> mind, I will
not presume to anticipate; but, as briefly as
possible I will give you an idea of the course
which I pursued myself with success.”</p>

<p>As my letter has run on to an overgrown
length, I will conclude it here, where the subject
naturally divides itself; and in my next will
proceed with my narrative, in the hope that
you will aid my purpose by observing on every
defect in the chain of my endeavours, and
furnishing strength to my weakness from the
stores of your own information. My whole
soul is engrossed in the cause which heaven has
blessed already beyond my most sanguine
expectations. Our dear friend, Mr. Otway, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a powerful auxiliary. I should say that he were
the <i>principal</i> instrument, if his knowledge of
human nature did not teach him to lie by in a
great degree, till I, as a pioneer, have cleared
the path. “The still small voice” of female
affection, like the mouse in the fable, will sometimes
achieve more than the lion’s force, and I
am heartily contented to rank no higher than
“yon wee bit sleek, and cowering beastie.” as
our favourite Burns styles this tiny animal, if I
may only be permitted by my humble efforts,
to unloose the cords which would restrain the
spirit’s flight, and bind to groveling earth an
angel of the skies.</p>

<p>Adieu, dear friend,</p>

<p class="center">Your faithful and affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Caroline Douglas</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2>LETTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="smcap">From the same to the same.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Marsden.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear Friend,</p>

<p>You are expecting a letter, and it shall be
delayed no longer. To return to the subject
of my last: my brother confessed, as I told you,
that his great difficulties lay in questions <i>without</i>
the range of Bible testimony, considered
either as a system of moral virtue, or a history
of mankind.</p>

<p>“I know enough,” added he, “to give it the
palm of excellence over the several claims of
Confucius, Menu, Zoroaster, and Mohammed.
The nobleness of its <i>principle</i>, in making the
love of God stand forward grandly as the only
test of true religion, is sufficient to raise it
beyond the finest compositions of human skill,
which rest their foundations in convenience or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
necessity. I am likewise aware that much of
what is to be admired in the best specimens of
ancient wisdom, is directly imitated from the
laws of Moses. I know that this lawgiver has
been the means of preserving the people committed
to his charge, and that too amidst the
most tremendous reverses and astonishing
vicissitudes of fortune for almost four thousand
years by the same laws; while the boasted
Grecian philosophy of the Lycurgus’, the
Solons, the Platos, though indebted to him, has
passed away in empty air. I know also, that
the infidel hue and cry that Moses borrowed his
plans of jurisprudence and morality from the
Egyptians, has been transmitted through the
crowd as mere sound divested of sense, and is
easily arrested by the least degree of acquaintance
with that mythology from which unbelievers
pretend to derive the <i>Hebraical Institutes</i>.
Could I be <i>assured</i> that I am to live hereafter,
the Bible should unquestionably be the light and
staff of my journey towards that unseen world
which <i>you</i> are so certain of beholding, and in
the existence of which there is nothing revolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to my understanding, except the difficulty of
<i>knowing myself</i> in a disembodied state. What
is to convince me of my identity?”</p>

<p>To this question I ventured to reply, “The
argument of identity has been much misunderstood
by a large portion of mankind, including
almost all the sceptics whose writings I am
acquainted with, and who confound this idea
with that of <i>consciousness</i>. Now, Butler, whose
book you see before you, has admirably and
clearly drawn the true distinction, and shewn
that <i>consciousness takes cognizance</i> of identity,
but is not the thing itself. You may sleep for a
million of years as for a single night, without
destroying your identity. Were it not so, each
interruption from forgetfulness, however short,
or from whatever cause, whether a natural
slumber, lapse of memory, epileptic fit, swoon,
or contusion of the brain, would be as fatal to
the continuity of <i>self</i>, as the longest term of
oblivion.</p>

<p>“How then do I arrive at the idea of identity?
I say by <i>intuitive</i> knowledge, so totally independent
of the circumstances with which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
combined in the body, that these may undergo
every variety of change without impairing its
force. Suppose that you were taken at your
birth, like Hunter, and brought up amongst the
North American Indians; that you believed a
tatooed chief of a particular village to be your
father, and a certain squaw to be your mother.
At one-and-twenty, you are brought to Europe,
and discover, by a remarkable chain of circumstances,
that you are <i>not</i> a North American Indian,
but a child of British parents. You are
<i>not</i> what you believed yourself to be; yet <i>this</i>
has nothing to do with your identity&mdash;you are
still <i>yourself</i>.</p>

<p>“Suppose again, that by successive cannon shots,
you have been deprived of your limbs; your
arms and legs have been shot away, and, as
nearly as is compatible with continued existence,
you are reduced to a mere trunk. No diminution
takes place in the consciousness of your
personal identity, any more than results from
the gradual substitution of new particles which,
it is calculated, replace those which composed
the whole of the former body, once in every seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
years. <i>Memory of the past</i> is not necessary
to our belief that <i>we are ourselves</i>. Whole
years may be blotted from our recollection, and
still we have some invisible, intuitive assurance
that we have continuity of being, and have not
gone through any metempsychosis, which destroys
it; but this knowledge is limited by certain
boundaries, beyond which we have absolutely
nothing to guide us, except the evidence
of <i>other people</i>. Ask yourself solemnly, and
searchingly, what is your ground for believing
that, ere you saw the light, you lived during
nine months in another state as different from
your present condition of existence, as the present
union of body and spirit can possibly be
from a future mode of being in which the soul,
freed from human restraint, shall expatiate with
as much more liberty than it can now exert, as
it enjoys at present, when compared with the
former period of its imprisonment.</p>

<p>“Is there one human creature who could be so
certain that you are absolutely the person for
whom we take you, as not by <i>possibility</i> to be
deceived? Even your <i>mother</i>, after her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had yearned to the first faint cry of her own
baby, may have been deceived. Suppose that
her own had died, and that you were presented
to her. <i>How</i> do you know <i>what</i> or <i>where</i> you
were before sensible objects began to make impression
on your faculties? You have no more
actual <i>connection</i> with your former being, even
during the first six or eight months,&mdash;I might
go on to say the first year of childhood&mdash;when
you slept in your nurse’s arms, than you have
with that oak that overshadows your window, if
you estimate that connection by your power of
tracing its links without any hiatus in the chain.</p>

<p>“You were pleased the other day with that admirable
essay, which you were reading, entitled
“Historical doubts respecting the existence of
Napoleon Buonaparte,” in which the argument
is so perfectly established that, if we give reins
to scepticism, we have no <i>demonstrative</i> proof,
at this moment, that the wonderful Buonaparte
who swayed the world by the magic of an almost
preternatural influence for a few years, and is
now <i>forgotten</i>, put himself under the protection
of Captain Maitland, and visited Spithead on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
board the Bellerophon. What wonder that you
should know no more than that your boat put
off from the shore, on which you saw a dense
crowd of assembled spectators, that you neared
the stern of a great vessel, saw a little man with
a star on his breast and a cocked hat upon his
head, were told and <i>believed</i> that it was the
royal prisoner, the usurper of France, the wizard
Corsican at whom you gazed from your wherry,
when you have no <i>demonstration</i> that you are
General Douglas, no <i>irrefragable</i> proof that you
belong to that line of Scottish heroes from
whom you believe yourself to be sprung, and
may not be, on the contrary, a foundling transplanted
from the parish of St. Giles’ into your
splendid cradle, where first you received the
fond caresses of your reputed parents.</p>

<p>“See then how much we are <i>obliged</i> to take
for granted; and is there any greater difficulty in
believing that consciousness of identity, which
we never doubted, may form a part of our essence
hereafter, than that it is inseparable from
our existence here, however the continuity of
remembrance may be interrupted? All <i>analogy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
is with me, and I now find this idea, which
once was a stumbling block, easy and familiar.</p>

<p>“Then, as to the soul’s existence after being
separated from the body. Let us only consider
how unreasonably we argue, when we confound
the mental and corporeal functions, simply because
we see them combined. Analogy here
also is against such reasoning. A spark of electricity
or galvanism is only rendered <i>apparent</i>
to the eye by certain circumstances. As long
as these subtle fluids pass quietly through conductors,
they are wholly invisible, and pervade
the earth and atmosphere entirely unseen: yet
we doubt not the existence of electricity and
magnetism, because they float invisibly in æther.
We never doubt the existence of the sun’s light,
though the substitution of a wooden block for a
transparent window of glass shall totally obstruct
his rays. These are mere analogies; but
they are in our favour. We see the operations
of the spirit through the means of our bodily organs,
as we perceive the light of the sun through
glass, which is so constituted as to transmit its
beams to our senses; but we have no more right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to confound the vehicle, or medium, with the
matter of light, or the power of thought, conveyed
in the one case than in the other. Will
you call me fanciful if I say that I consider all
intellectual energy, all that we denominate <i>soul</i>,
as emanating from divinity; and I find no more
difficulty <i>now</i> in imagining a certain portion of
this divine principle arrested and concentrated
in the organic structure which we call man, than
I find in collecting the sun’s rays in a burning
glass or a prism.</p>

<p>“Mingling with the dross incident to a temporary
junction with the base particles of matter,
the spirit partakes of the feculence of the channel
through which it permeates (if you will permit
me to use the language of metaphor), just
as the rays of the sun are broken, refracted, or
reflected by the cloudy atmosphere, or shattered
glass, through which they pass. Remove the
medium, and the emancipated essence regains
its source; with this difference, that while the
light, which is only material, the magnetism and
electricity, which are unconscious forces, recover
all their purity with their liberated expansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the soul of man, on which the boon of immortality
is conferred,&mdash;the soul which shall not be
extinguished like that splendid orb that illumines
our nether sphere shall receive its final billet, and
be admitted into one or the other of two classes
of spiritualized existence, <i>according</i> to the use
which has been made during its sojournment in
the body, of <i>free will</i>, bestowed upon the human
species at its creation.”</p>

<p>Here my brother heaved a sigh, which seemed
to issue from the very centre of his heart: “Aye,
Caroline,” said he, “there’s the rub; there is
the inscrutable mystery, the impenetrable veil;”
“Which,” answered I, “no mortal intellect&mdash;no
human eye will ever pierce.”&mdash;“Then how
<i>believe</i> what I despair of comprehending?”
“If,” replied I, “we turn a subject according
to two opposite theories, and after the clearest
investigation which we are enabled to bestow
upon each, find that both involve an equal measure
of incompatibility with our reason and experience,
we arrive at least naturally at a state
of neutrality which would leave us unbiased and
ready to lean to one side or the other, as <i>new</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
motives might be suggested to incline the understanding
through force of evidence or probability,
towards the adoption of one scheme
in preference to the other, its <i>own</i> powers being
confessedly unequal to unravel the difficulties
of either. Let us view the wonderful
question of free-will in this light: that the
Almighty could <i>decree</i> man to be free, we have
no reason to deny. Omnipotence can achieve
<i>all</i> things; and even were we inclined to declare,
that not being satisfied that free-will exists,
we will not give credit to the Great
Framer of the universe for more than we see,
still we are <i>pinned</i> on the other side; for if we
only admit what we see, we cannot by the same
rule consistently negative that which we do <i>not</i>
see. <i>Ignorance</i> is not entitled to predicate for
or against. We can only with propriety say,
that what is hidden, is hidden. <i>But</i> my <i>experience</i>
tells me that I <i>am</i> free; and that when
not coerced from without, when not restrained
by extrinsic force, I follow the dictates of my
<i>will</i>, I find that no temptation assails me with
such violence as to make it <i>impossible</i> that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
should not have resisted its approaches: and
find that the common sense of all mankind is
with me, since every human law is founded on
the distinction between voluntary and compulsory
action. Every species of control, moral or
physical, is taken into account; every aberration
which disturbs the balance of the mental
faculties is allowed to operate favourably in excusing
the delinquent who is brought to judgment;
and nothing but <i>free</i>, <i>determined</i> wickedness
is punished by the laws of man. Whatever
injury has been sustained by society, <i>crime</i>
is not imputed to the person who has been
an unwilling instrument of wrong. So far
there is no contrariety in the decisions; no variety
amongst the opinions of men. What
says the Bible, which we have already agreed
should be the lamp of our feet, <i>provided</i> that
we submit to be guided where our own light is
not sufficient? It tells us, that God placing
us here in a merely probationary state, and
designing us for an ulterior destiny, made us
free <i>in order</i> to our being accountable. Now
that we should be accountable <i>without</i> being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
free is a solecism which no human sagacity
could comprehend, not merely because it is too
high for us to reach, <i>but</i> because it absolutely
contradicts that reason through the means of
which we come at the ideas of truth and
falsehood. The Bible says, that “good and
evil are placed before us,” and that we are
responsible at the bar of a future Tribunal for
the choice which we make between them.
Here is an exact accordance between revelation
and the natural conclusions of reason. Again, if
we consider what is most suitable to our ideas
of grandeur and power in the Deity, we hesitate
not in saying, that to form a <i>free</i> creature
is a much more magnificent exhibition of Divinity
than is manifested in the creation of puppets
that <i>must</i> obey the original impulse imparted
to them. How much grander is the
idea of an Almighty Ruler who, giving the
<i>greatest latitude</i> of action within its individual
sphere, to each separate congeries of nerves
and muscles, which He has ordained to be the
seat of a human soul, can so order the <i>ends</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of His astonishing plan, that not a <i>tittle</i> of
His word shall be frustrated; not a particle of
the great scheme subverted; than any notion
which we can substitute of a Creator who had
tied down and limited the work of His hands
in the moment of casting the first specimen of
its existence, so as to secure a monotonous and
necessary result from the mechanical revolution
of certain wheels, or the mindless operation of
certain fixed springs, not one of which could by
possibility vary in its round, or be altered in
the <i>quantum</i> of its elasticity. Thus far reason
and experience move harmoniously together,
and authority confirms their joint conclusion.
We <i>feel</i> that we are free; reason tells us that
we <i>ought</i> to be free; and Scripture, which professes
to be the revealed Word of God, informs
us that we <i>are</i> free. The mass of probability
appears, then, entirely on this side: let us now
consider the other.</p>

<p>“If man be a mere machine, irresistibly
governed according to fixed laws, from which
he cannot swerve, and performing every action
through the influence of an impelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
power, which he is unable to resist; it is plain,
first, that he cannot be an accountable creature,
for accountableness can only be understood when
there is liberty to do, or abstain from doing;
and, secondly, this scheme involves an absolute
contradiction between our experience and the
fact, supposing us to be creatures of necessity,
by which, if we be really overruled, and placed
in <i>duresse</i> from which we have no power to
emancipate ourselves; we are, then, put into
the extraordinary predicament of <i>being</i> one
thing, while we are so constituted as to <i>believe</i>
ourselves to be another. That is to say,
in fine, that we are <i>conscious</i> of freedom, though
in reality we are bound; and are thus practically
and irresistibly acting all our lives upon a
fraud, a delusion, which compels us to give up
the testimony of our senses, at the same time
that we declare their evidence to furnish the
most unquestionable source of knowledge that
we possess, and to afford the principal rule upon
which our whole conduct is regulated, either
in public or private life.</p>

<p>“There is a sublime simplicity in the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of Providence, in comparison with which the
strange incongruity which I have been describing
would present a case so completely anomalous
as to disturb the harmony of creation,
and leave us a bewildered race, without helm
or compass to guide our course. But a contradiction
still more monstrous and difficult to
reconcile would result from such an order of
things as we are now supposing. The necessity
which we are considering must either be independent
of, or immediately proceeding from,
God. If the former, it supersedes the Deity,
or, identified with Him, is itself the sovereign
ruler of the universe. If the latter, all the evil
deeds of man are performed by the <i>express
order</i> of that Being who threatens with eternal
punishment those of his creatures who will not
obey His commandment to be “holy even as
He is holy.” The preposterous absurdities involved
in this view are levelled at once by the
belief that man at his birth is <i>decreed</i> to be a
free agent, all whose actions are in his own
power; who will never be tempted above what
he is enabled to bear; and who, if he sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>desire</i> after righteousness, will never fail in attaining
it.</p>

<p>“How far the <i>ultimate ends</i> of all that we
see may be <i>fixed</i> by the fiat of Divine ordinances,
is not our business to inquire into,
any more than what future worlds the Creator
may please to form when our planetary
system shall have passed away. Our own actions
are our immediate concern: thousands
of <i>events</i> may hinge upon every one of them,
with which we do not <i>design</i> the remotest connection;
while the ends which we <i>intend</i> to
bring about are never achieved. Yet, in secular
matters, no man ever believes his free will
to have been restrained. If he make a bad
bargain, or act upon a false calculation, he may
regret his want of prudence, or lament a deficiency
of information; but it never occurs to
the most sceptical amongst those with whom I
have ever met, to fancy, for a single moment,
that he <i>might</i> not have done differently, inquired
farther, or been less precipitate.</p>

<p>“Whence this <i>division</i>? Why are temporal
affairs regulated by the law of responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
while spiritual conduct only is to be considered
under the inflexible control of a <i>necessary</i> compulsion?
The reason is plain: the creed of the
fatalist is only adopted to screen him from the
examination which he dreads, and serve as an
opiate to his conscience. The fatalism of the
ancient heathen world was more rational and
consistent than that of modern infidelity, inasmuch
as it was applied to earthly concerns, and
frequently led to contentment under misfortune
and privation. Perhaps you are ready to say
how much less puzzling you would find the doctrine
of free-will than that of necessity were it
not for one stumbling block. How can fore-knowledge
be reconciled with freedom? Were
human analogies to satisfy our inquiry, there
would be no difficulty to encounter in this question.
In <i>this</i> world, the prophetic wisdom
which, like that of Edmund Burke, looks deeply
into the volume of futurity, and predicts events
to come, is rarely, if ever concerned in the practical
occurrence of them; but on the contrary,
is generally in diametrical opposition, as he was
to the horrors of that revolution which he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
clearly foresaw. So far analogy <i>separates</i> fore-knowledge
from necessity. Imagine <i>once</i> that
man is created <i>free</i> by the Almighty’s decree,
and the difficulty vanishes. If <i>free</i>, man is empowered
to act for himself; and though <i>beyond</i>
a certain limit he may not be able to <i>see</i> or to
<i>do</i>, he has liberty <i>within</i> a given circuit, and
that liberty once conferred, there is nothing
more incomprehensible in the fore-knowledge of
God, than in that of an earthly parent, who
having <i>endowed</i> his children with a certain measure
of power, limited by his discretion, and recallable
at his will, <i>foresees</i>, without <i>choosing</i> to
control its exercise. That species of active interference
sometimes employed to bring about
the designs of self-interest by people who plan
devices, and then are busied in executing them;
is not what we mean by fore-knowledge <i>humanly</i>
speaking. What we speak of as such, is founded
on information from without, and derived from
our own judgment in drawing conclusions relative
to future events from certain data presented
to our understandings. I repeat, therefore,
that so far from being accustomed to couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
this species of wisdom with the facts which it
predicts, there is, generally speaking, not the
most remote connection between the prognostic
and its fulfilment. Now, as all our ideas respecting
the divine attributes, when we depend
on reason alone for believing in them, are but
an extension of those which we see in each
other, we are not instructed by any analogy to
<i>expect</i> that the prescience of the Almighty brings
about the downfall of a nation as its <i>necessary
consequence</i>, any more than that Burke’s foresight
of the effects which would follow on the
spread of infidelity and disloyalty should be instrumental
in compassing the overthrow of
monarchy in France. Nor <i>should</i> we reason so
anomalously, were it not that in considering
God as the <i>creator</i> of all those beings whose
conduct he foresees, looking in short, upon the
divine fore-knowledge as <i>infallible</i>, and not subject
to the <i>contingencies</i> which accompany even
the highest degree of human sagacity, we attach
a <i>characteristic</i> to the prescience of the
Deity which does not belong to that of man;
and therefore while reason and analogy are professedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
our guides, we desert their standard,
and set up a new light for ourselves which is as
remote from revealed as from natural religion,
and leaves us inextricably <i>bogged</i> in a morass
from which we shall in vain attempt to disentangle
ourselves. If the Almighty <i>made us free</i>,
we can imagine how he may fore-know our
actions without controlling them; though he
formed all created things, because in the very
idea of <i>freedom</i>, such independence is <i>essential</i>;
any compulsion would destroy liberty, and involve
a contradiction in terms; but here is the
final limit to which human understanding can
attain.</p>

<p>“<i>How</i> this wonderful union of divine power,
and the creature’s free agency is effected, belongs
to higher matters than we can reach. We only
know, as I said before, that we know <i>nothing, if
we are not free</i>. The arguments of a necessitarian
may seem irrefragable, and convince you
that you are impelled to every action; but in
the moment that you close his book you <i>feel</i>
that you can open or shut it at pleasure, and
call up, or dismiss at will, those motives from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
your mind, which shall be the <i>proximate</i> and
immediate causes of your so doing.</p>

<p>“In like manner Berkeley has perhaps convinced
you in the abstract that you cannot
vouch for the existence of matter, and that
ideas or shadows are all that you can answer
for; but do you really and substantially believe
less in the existence of a bullet which blows out
the brains of a fellow creature, or that of the
sword which pierces his body, because Berkeley
assures you that they are only <i>ideas</i>, and you
are not able <i>metaphysically</i> to contradict him?</p>

<p>“You have, my beloved brother, honoured
me so far as to consult my understanding upon
these great, these awful subjects, and nothing
could tempt me to accept the office of guide,
conscious as I am of my own weakness, were I
not firmly persuaded, that while mortal affairs
require human strength to unravel their intricacies,
and overcome their obstructions, humility
is the only pilot to heaven.</p>

<p>“I was once led astray in the mazes of a bewildering
philosophy which grew darker and
more uncertain the farther I presumed to penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
its recesses. I found torches, indeed, blazing
at the portals, and proud of a little daring, I
entered on the labyrinth, vain-gloriously resolved
to reject all clue, and clear a passage for
myself; but the damps of ignorance and doubt
soon extinguished the glaring lights that illuminated
the entrance. I found myself ere long
involved in the thickest obscurity, and when the
abyss threatened to engulph the groping wanderer,
was grateful for that aid which in the
pride of my own strength, I had indignantly
rejected. Assisted by revelation, I retraced my
erring steps; and am now contented with such
measure of knowledge as God vouchsafes to his
creatures, as well as resolved never more to
tempt the paths which lead but to confusion
worse confounded.</p>

<p>“Where difficulties present themselves, I
thankfully incline to that side which is the
least obscure; and, as a belief in necessity,
besides the natural contrariety of its existence
with the evidence of our senses, which proclaim
us free agents, would involve an absolute and
unqualified rejection of the Christian scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I find no hesitation in abandoning it to the
winds.</p>

<p>“Natural religion presents God to our contemplation
in the wonderful unapproachable
character of sovereignty, wisdom, and power.
The <i>Christian</i> sees him brought home to our
hearts, and domesticated with our gratitude,
our tenderness, and admiration. In Jesus
Christ we behold the Emanuel, the <i>God</i> with
us; redeeming in his love, sustaining by his
spirit, astonishing by his mercy. If I turn
from the only door, the only way, the only shepherd
that is provided for me, and look to myself
for a staff of support through the valley of
death, what do I find? Alas! infirmity so pitiable,
sin so inseparable from every purpose and
every performance, that I am ready to give my
suffrage to the truth of Hooker’s eloquent, but
melancholy avowal, that ‘the very best action
of the most virtuous human being, <i>requires to be
forgiven</i>.’”</p>

<p>You have now, my dear friend, an outline of
the plan upon which we set out with our search
after Truth: and from the moment in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the conversation that I have reported took
place, my brother has passed some hours of
every day in reading and talking on these solemn
subjects.</p>

<p>Butler’s Analogy with Wilson’s excellent
Letters of Explanation; Gregory’s Letters and
Chalmers’ Evidences, have particularly delighted
him. We have read <i>Tremaine</i> together,
and some parts of the reasoning contained
in the third volume of that valuable little work
have most powerfully impressed his mind, while
others have failed of satisfying him. My principal
objections to Tremaine are, that the author
contents himself with allowing us to <i>suppose</i>
that the hero becomes a Christian. Secondly,
Dr. Evelyn, though a very worthy, and
a very sensible man, appears more like a good
humoured country gentleman, than a clergyman,
the professional piety of whom might have
been added to his counsel without detracting
from its force. It is a pity also that so strong a
stimulant as love should be allowed by <i>possibility</i>
to mingle in the motives to conversion, and
by so doing, sully the integrity of change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
With these defects, however, and some inequalities
in the argument, Tremaine is a charming
work, and breathes nothing from beginning to
end, which is not calculated, in some way or
other, to render people wiser and better who read
it; a character which it would be a great happiness
were to be able with truth to attribute in
this age of novels to many of the most celebrated
amongst them.</p>

<p>Having said so much of my invalid’s <i>mind</i>,
I must mournfully add of his <i>bodily</i> frame,
that it gradually declines, yet so imperceptibly,
that it requires such minute observation as
strong affection can alone awaken, to perceive
the progress of decay. My dear children, and
our friend Mr. Otway, unite in kindest remembrances
to you. Speak of us all to our poor
neighbours with affectionate recollection, and
tell them that I long to re-visit my little valley,
and am only supported through the pain of absence
from home, and the fatigue of more
society, than for many years I have been accustomed
to, by the pleasant assurance that I am
not <i>uselessly</i> employed. The remarks of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
young people, in a land of strangers, furnish
me too with a perpetual source of gratification,
they are so true to nature and good sense, as
well as feeling. We continue to hear constantly
from Arthur, who is happy in the company of
Mr. Charles Falkland, a young man whose
friendship I anticipate for my Frederick with
great pleasure. We hear also of Lord and
Lady Crayton, of whom I wish I could
add that our accounts are agreeable. Lord C.
is, I fear, ill calculated to make my poor niece
happy; and they both exhibit, but too faithfully,
a specimen of fashionable marriage. I
tremble, as I look forward, and bless God when
I gaze with thankfulness on my children, that
they have been preserved from the vortex of
folly, which draws thousands daily into its dangerous
and seductive abyss. Can all the riches
of the East, added to all “the boast of
heraldry, and pomp of power,” supply the
place of domestic love, or compensate for the
absence of moral virtue? I sometimes feel like
an old picture that, after having been hung up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
during a century, has suddenly received the
gift of animation, and descended from its frame
to mingle in the social group. The <i>world</i>,
even as seen at this distance from our metropolis,
appears almost as new to me as to my
girls; and, I am sorry to confess, how little
find in it to gratify my mental taste. Perhaps
retirement may have soured my disposition,
but if this be not the case, society is not <i>improved</i>
in this kingdom. We are encircled by
people of princely fortune; and luxury, in all
its fertility of invention, reigns throughout this
rich and beautiful country. But, oh! how
much I miss the England of my early recollections!
Mr. Otway and I often mourn over the
progress of what is falsely called refinement,
which has made the lower classes forget the simple
sobriety, the active industry, the nice cleanliness
of former times, and has rendered the
higher orders a disgusting engraftment of foreign
manners, customs, and language, upon a British
stock. My dear home! My pure mountain
breezes and rational fire-side, I sigh to behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
you once more! Adieu, my valued friend.
I hope to hear from you before we leave Marsden,
and am,</p>

<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Caroline Douglas</span>.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smcap">From Emily Douglas to Miss Sandford.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">My dearest Julia,</p>

<p>This will, probably, be my last letter from
Marsden, unless any unfavourable change in
my dear uncle’s health should alter the present
arrangements for our departure. We are to
go by Brighton and Dieppe, instead of by the
route first proposed; and you may expect to
hear from me as frequently as possible, though
I shall never persecute you with my <i>travels as
travels</i>: for I do believe there is nothing left
in France or Italy, which has not been <i>served
up</i> in every practicable variety of form, to meet
each different character of taste; but I trust to
your affection for finding interest in every stage
of our journey, though the map of it be so
familiar to your memory as to deprive me of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hope to amuse you by descriptions of scenery
or costumes. Since I wrote last, I have seen
much that was new to <i>me</i>, without going abroad;
and, though I should be very ungrateful not to
acknowledge thankfully the great kindness with
which we have been received in Hampshire, I
cannot permit <i>even</i> gratitude to blind me, and
confound distinctions which I never desire to
see melted into an undistinguishable mass of
uniform colouring. My dear Julia, I sometimes
stare with such amazement at the things
that present themselves, as to fear that my
eye-lids may be overstrained, and lose the power
of closing; but, instead of egotizing on the
effects produced upon my mind, I will beg you
to accompany me to three or four splendid mansions
in our neighbourhood, where you shall
judge for yourself. About a week ago, Mr.
Otway, Frederick, Charlotte, and I, took a
delightful ride through the New Forest, to pay
our respects to Mrs. Hannaper, a <i>Begum</i> of
this country, who commands several hundred
votes, and who is, therefore, a grand bone of
contention in this terrible electioneering struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
She has a beautiful niece, Miss Ormsby,
who is dressed all over in the colours of that
party which her aunt espouses; and is so full of
<i>stripes</i> that she might be supposed to have made
her gown and shawl out of the flag of a ship
belonging to the United States. This young lady
assists Mrs. Hannaper in canvassing for her favourite
candidate, to whom it is said that she is to
be married; and I have heard many gentlemen
complain of being attacked with such perseverance,
as to find great difficulty in retreating
from the united influence of beauty and supplication.
As we rode along, several groups of
riotous, drunken men, in smock frocks, bearing
bunches of buff and blue ribbons in their
hats, interrupted our progress, and startled our
horses, by tumultuary shouts which rent the
air with cries “Sir Christopher Cromie, and
Mrs. Hannaper for ever!” As we approached
to Lyndhurst, the vociferation increased, and
we were just consulting whether it would not
be prudent to turn about, when a crowd came
rushing down the road, which branched off at
right angles with that by which we were journeying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
forward; and we found ourselves immediately
surrounded by three or four hundred
people, who had taken Mrs. Hannaper’s horses
from the carriage in which she and her niece
were sitting, and insisted on drawing them
home themselves, to testify their attachment to
the cause which she patronizes. Mrs. Hannaper
is apparently from sixty to sixty-five,
with a face and form neither rough nor unpleasing;
but a cloth habit, tight beaver hat, over a
Brutus wig, a coloured silk handkerchief tied
round her throat, and a collar rising almost to
her cheek bones, gave so masculine an air as
completely to deceive me, while the interposition
of some drooping branches of an ash
tree concealed the lower part of her dress from
my view. She stood up in her barouchette,
waved her hat to the multitude, huzzaed, and
acted so like a man upon the occasion, that
when I came near enough to see a petticoat, I
blushed for the honour of my sex. Her niece
held a parasol over her head, and seemed less
inclined to make these outrageous demonstrations
than her aunt; but she held a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
banner in the left hand with Sir Christopher’s
name worked in gold letters, and her hat was
ornamented with a great cockade of his colours.
The carriage stopped when we appeared, and
Mrs. Hannaper covering her head sat down,
and desiring Mr. Otway, whom she had previously
seen, to present my brother, sister, and
me, very politely requested us to breakfast on
the following day, when she meant, as she told
us, to turn out a bagged fox; and her “Liliputians”&mdash;the
name by which she distinguished
a favourite pack of some tiny breed, with the
technical appellation of which I am unacquainted.
“Come early,” added she, “Sir
Christopher, and a few friends, will be at Parham,
where I shall be happy to see you.” I
was beginning to say why we could not accept
her kind invitation, when, in the same moment,
I read “do let us go” in Frederick’s
eye, and a glance from Mr. Otway’s, in which
was legibly written, “it is something <i>new</i>, do
not refuse.” I suppose that I mismanaged my
excuse, for Mrs. Hannaper, nothing daunted,
replied, “oh really you <i>must</i> come, I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
take refusals.” Mr. Otway told her that <i>some</i>
of the party would certainly attend her; and
the intoxicated <i>leaders</i> becoming impatient of
so long a parley, threw up a cloud of hats into
the air, with a deafening uproar, and the ladies
were whirled along to our no small contentment,
for our steeds threatened, by the noise,
to become ungovernable. When we had resumed
our peaceful track, we interchanged, as
you may believe, some remarks upon the extraordinary
vision that had just crossed our path.
Mr. Otway was excessively amused by Charlotte’s
asking whether Mrs. Hannaper, and her
niece, were <i>Blue-stockings</i>. “No, I dare say
not,” answered our friend. “Why do <i>you</i>
suppose them to be so?” “Oh,” replied Charlotte,
“I have no reason, further than that
from the masculine air of these ladies, I conclude
that they must be disliked extremely by
the other sex, and perhaps considered <i>intruders</i>
sufficiently to be called <i>Blues</i>.” An explanation
ensued, and we learned that, though it is
an inexcusable offence for a woman to fancy
that she possesses any understanding, or is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
capable of any mental acquirement, notwithstanding
that Heaven may have bestowed upon
her the brightest abilities, it is perfectly admissible,
under certain circumstances, to be a
female <i>Nimrod</i>&mdash;to hunt and course, dress like
a mail coachman, drive a curricle at full speed,
ride like a Bedouin Arab, and be in at the
death. Nay, Mr. Otway assured us, that Mrs.
Hannaper is generally ornamented by the Fox’s
brush in returning from the chase, and that she
cries talliho with peculiar gusto! “But then,”
added he, “she is a woman of immense fortune;
and, however people might laugh at inferior
folk, so many gentlemen are aspiring to
the hand of this Diana, that a thousand knights
would take the field to resent the slightest indignity
offered to the goddess of their adoration.”
No language can paint my astonishment
to learn that this old lady went out hunting;
to hear her huzzaing, and to see her manly
costume, had been wonder enough for one day;
<i>but</i> to fancy it possible, that a <i>veteran</i> belle of
Mrs. Hannaper’s age, could dream of marriage,
or, like queen Elizabeth, permit herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in <i>this</i> age of the world, to be surrounded by
people <i>daring</i> to talk of love to a <i>woman of
sixty</i>, was something beyond my comprehension
or credulity. For the first time in my
life I thought, dearest Mr. Otway ill-natured,
and, slackening my pace, fell back with Charlotte,
allowing him, and Frederick, to take the
lead&mdash;shall I own my weakness? I felt so humbled
for my sex, that low spirits took possession
of me; a melancholy dialogue succeeded, and
a hearty fit of tears relieved the oppression
which manners so novel had occasioned. My
sister, and I, entreated that we might not be
forced to attend the morning party; so Frederick
went alone, and came back thoroughly
disgusted with all that he saw. A gay party
met at a breakfast <i>à la fourchette</i>, where the
ladies, he told us, played their parts most
vigorously at ham, dried fish, and all sorts of
substantial fare, not disdaining to wash it down
with a glass of champagne.</p>

<p>“To horse, to horse,” was the next order of
the day, and the ladies, dressed in uniform, rode
in the most sportsman-like manner, clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
gates, banks, and ditches. I cannot dwell upon
the disgraceful theme. Alas! is learning decried?
Are women ridiculed for improving
their minds, and gaining useful knowledge,
while such a surrender of every characteristic
that distinguishes the feminine from the masculine
gender, is tolerated and encouraged? I
feel a <i>nausea</i> when I hear the name of Hannaper;
but I have not done with her yet. In a
day or two after our meeting, she came to see
us, having duly ascertained that my uncle would
not give his interest to either party at the approaching
election; and certainly nothing can
be more appropriate than the name by which she
is called in the country. “<i>Jack Hannaper</i>,”
exactly prepares one for the abrupt masculine
unceremonious <i>assault</i> which she makes on the
people at whose houses she visits. Mamma’s
gentle and retiring manner, the gravity of her
dress, and total absence of interest in the gossip
of the neighbourhood, induced the Dame of
Parham Hall, to address herself chiefly to my
uncle, whom she overpowered with her volubility.
After having talked of her dogs which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
have got the distemper, of a horse which she
had shot, <i>perhaps</i> with her own hand, because
it had the glanders, she proceeded, and with
all the technicality of the hustings, proclaimed
the state of the poll, her intention of appearing
on a favourite charger at the head of her <i>plumpers</i>,
and giving a <i>coup de grace</i> to the enemy.
Perceiving, it may be, from the languid appearance
of my dear uncle, that he was fatigued by
this farrago of nonsense, Mrs. Hannaper suddenly
turned to me, and said, “Oh, but my dear
Miss Douglas, you really had a great loss in
not coming to Parham the other day. We had
very good fun I assure you, and I dare say you
will be glad to hear that your brother was much
admired. He rides particularly well, and no
centaur ever sat a horse more firmly. Upon
my word he is a very handsome fine young
fellow, and I have no doubt will make a figure
yet. I shall be always happy to see him at
Parham Hall.” Frederick’s praises would go
far to put me in good humour with any medium
through which they met my ear; but these fell
upon it in sounds so coarse, and unaccustomed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that I felt they were a sort of profanation, and
wished that my brother had never joined the
unrefined society of this <i>unfeminine female</i>.
My cheeks glowed, but not with pleasure. It
was a fevered flush. I longed for Mrs. Hannaper’s
departure, and did not know how to
answer her; but she did not leave me many
seconds in a state of embarrassment on Frederick’s
account. All minor vexation was presently
merged in the shame which I felt on my
<i>own</i>, when this “she wolf with unrelenting
fangs,” seized my arm, and, starting with real
or affected recollection, exclaimed, “Well, but
only fancy my omitting to tell you before, that
Sir Archibald Johnson is thinking of you for
his son, who makes no kind of objection, and
if your fortune can liberate the estate from some
thousands of embarrassment, it will be quite a
nice hit. Lady Johnson of Norbury Park will
not sound badly. The settlements and <i>pin
money</i> will be liberal I dare say, and any assistance
which my work-people in London can
give, I shall be vastly happy, I assure you, to
offer. You know that you need not have much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
at present: a few things made by the first
hands will do, till you go to town yourself, and
choose your own jewels, and select your own
favourite colours. I am sure that Sir Archibald
will be anxious to hasten matters, for I know at
this moment, that a sum of ten thousand is
called in by Mr. Fletcher, who is going to
marry one of his girls famously to that madcap,
Colonel Anstruther, who will be as rich as a
jew bye and bye. To be sure he is a sad <i>roué</i> at
present, but either he will sow his wild oats or
run a muck. If the latter, he will shoot himself,
or end his days in the Fleet; but people must
not look forward; if we did, what a dull sort of
thing you know it would be. I doat on the
little Scotch song, which says ‘the present
moment is our ain, the next we never saw;’ how
pretty!”</p>

<p>By this time I was burning indeed: shame,
indignation, and surprise, were so strongly
excited, that, like contrary forces, they had the
effect of paralyzing all movement. I sat like a
fool, totally unable to speak; and how long I
should have been doomed to listen to a strain so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
uncouth, the more humiliating, because uttered
in the presence of mamma and my uncle, I
know not, if Mr. Bolton had not been announced
in this crisis, when Mrs. Hannaper
jumped up, called her niece, who had been
talking to Charlotte in the music-room adjoining,
and, hastily nodding to me, shook my hand
with an air of <i>intelligence</i>, saying, “I hate old
Bolton, so must take fresh ground; well, we
will talk over matters when next we meet, and
<i>perhaps</i> the neighbourhood may be enlivened
by more than <i>one</i> wedding ere long.” Miss
Ormsby laughed so loud as this sally burst upon
her ear, that I was absolutely confounded.
“Good morrow” being hurried over, the same
opening of the door served to usher in the old
gentleman, to whose <i>rescue</i> I had been once
before indebted, and to float away the most intolerable
specimen of inelegance and indelicacy
that I ever met with in the form of woman.
The dear little Mr. Bolton was received with
rapture. He seemed like a guardian spirit,
and I believe that he saw how truly he was welcome
to me, as in the most good-humoured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
playful manner possible, he said, “Oh, do you
know I have had a great escape. Mrs. Hannaper
looked as if she could have eaten me up;
and only that your hall is so spacious, I question
whether I could have avoided a <i>bite</i> at least.
Miss Douglas, I take it into my head that this
amazonian <i>chieftainess</i> is not a greater favourite
of yours than she is of mine.” I confessed that
she would not be my <i>model</i>, and Mr. Bolton
continued, “But you and I shall have ample
revenge, if I may depend on a little bit of <i>backstairs</i>
intelligence which has reached me through
my own man.</p>

<p>“Now, you must not set me down as an old
gossip because I tell you so, and suppose that I
am always employed in running to and fro, to
pick up scandal; but really poetic justice requires
that such a creature as Mrs. Hannaper
should receive <i>some</i> check, and be reminded of
her age, before she is called to her great account.
So far therefore, from thinking myself
ill-natured at <i>chuckling</i> in the anticipation of a
disappointment, which I have good reason to
believe is suspended by a hair over her head, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
am bound as a Christian to rejoice in any thing
that may awaken her to a sense of her folly,
and drive her to more serious thoughts than
those which possess her idle brain.”</p>

<p>Much as I dislike Mrs. Hannaper, there was
something so repugnant to my feelings of humanity
in suffering a fellow-creature to encounter
any ill, which timely notice might prevent,
that I expostulated with Mr. Bolton, and implored
him to apprize the old lady of his apprehensions,
that so the catastrophe, however it
might threaten, should be averted. Mr. Bolton
was silent for a moment, while he fixed his eyes
intently upon me, then catching my hand affectionately,
he pressed it like a friend of the
“olden time,” and with a tear starting to his eye,
said, “God bless you child! my heart opens to
the voice of nature, and it has taken me by surprise
to-day, for her’s is a language which I seldom
hear.” Oh, Julia, when such a commonplace
sentiment as that which I had expressed,
in wishing to spare a fellow-creature pain, had
power to astonish by its novelty, and delight for
its moral virtue, what a comment is furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by such an anecdote as this upon modern
society. If this be the world (and people are
the same I suppose, whether rolling through
the streets of London, or over the roads in
Hampshire), defend me from its attractions. I
feel like the country mouse longing for my grey
peas and peaceful Glenalta; but the lovely
Alps will refresh my eyes with images of God’s
creation, and I shall soon bid farewell to these
disgusting scenes of artificial life.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton, after the little episode which I
have described, returned to the merry mood,
and rubbing his hands in an ecstacy, said, “No,
no, depend upon it I will be ‘mute as a coach-horse.’
You shall none of you know a word of
the under-plot which is weaving. I will not be
a tell-tale. Let all things take their course.”</p>

<p>This dear little man is the soul of pleasantry,
and seems to have an excellent heart, though
bound up in a quaint outside. He is <i>very</i> English,
and has a <i>snug</i> facetiousness of manner irresistibly
diverting. I hope that I may be fortunate
enough to meet him often in this neighbourhood,
for he has both tact and feeling; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
while his uncommon drollery amuses, his keen
observation protects. He seems to delight in
young people, and to understand <i>us</i>. My uncle
enjoys his company, and they had a great deal
of conversation, after which he took his leave,
entreating that we should not fail to meet him
at Lady Campion’s, to whose house we were invited
for the following morning, to a trial of
skill in archery. The time for these revels is
not yet come; but as several families are prevented
this year, I am told, from being in town,
through one cause or other, they are doing the
best they can to keep up the ball of pleasure, and
<i>rehearse</i> for a more full and fashionable season.
Mr. Bolton was <i>my</i> allurement, and the hope of
seeing him, emboldened me to go under the wing
of Mr. Otway, accompanied by Charlotte and
Frederick.</p>

<p>Lady Campion and her daughters are come
home within the last month, from Italy. They are
a lovely group. Mother and daughters beautiful,
and dressed in the same way, like sisters, it was
not easy to distinguish the parent from the offspring.
I do not like this. Surely the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
tender love may subsist without this confusion of
relationships. In the deep attachment which
binds my heart to the precious author of my
being, how sorry I should be even for a moment,
to forget that she is my <i>mother</i>. But
though not yet twenty, I feel as if I were fourscore,
when I look around me. Nothing
could be prettier than the little lawn on which
we marshalled to see the archers. The
graceful figures, the skill with which they managed
the bow, the beauty of the fair competitors,
clad in a livery of “Lincoln green,” the
exquisite flowers which perfumed the amphitheatre
of their sports, altogether charmed
Charlotte and me. We were asked to join the
lists, but as we could truly plead ignorance of
the art, we gladly dropped back upon a fringe
of the finest rhododendrons I ever beheld, lined
by a bank of arbutus, to witness the combat.
There were from forty to fifty spectators,
amongst whom were only two, besides Mr.
Bolton, whom I ever desire to see again.
These were a Mrs. and Miss Fraser, Scotch
people, a mother and daughter, very unlike our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pretty hostess, who, to my amazement, I found
was a rival candidate for the prize with her
<i>children</i>; and, alas, <i>can</i> you believe it! is jealous
of a Lord Thornborough’s attentions to the
elder of them. This young and vapid peer was
of our party; the most finnikin object that you
can imagine. He had called one day at Marsden,
so that I did not see him for the <i>first</i> time
at Lady Campion’s; and when he visited my
uncle, Fanny, whose <i>fresh naïveté</i> supplies a
constant source of amusement to us, said,
“Well, if in one of my walks I met Lord
Thornborough and his friend Mr. Freeman (a
young man of fashion who has accompanied him
to this country), I am sure that I could not help
offering them my assistance were there any difficulty
to be got over; for certainly those young
men could not help themselves over a hedge,
ditch, or stile.”</p>

<p>I <i>must</i> give you a sketch of this London pair.
They have both such heads for size, from the
abundance of curled hair and whiskers that disfigure
them, that if their bodies were concealed
you would expect to see giants, judging by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
proportion of limb that would suit such prodigious
<i>capitals</i>. On the contrary, however, they
are both rather diminutive than tall; their
hands are not larger than a young lady’s, and
as white as alabaster. Add to this appearance,
rings, pins, chains, &amp;c., and judge whether
Fanny was very wide of the mark, when, with
the rosy glow of sixteen, “redolent of life and
spring,” her humanity would prompt the offer
of her aid to creatures so pale, so thin, so cadaverous,
that Mr. Bolton very truly said, that
“they looked like weavers just out of an hospital.”
But I have not done. How <i>can</i> I believe
the things that I hear? Two pink spots,
which alone distinguished Lord Thornborough’s
face from that of a corpse, and which I thought
indicated consumption, are, Mr. Bolton declares,
positively rouge! I blush as I write the word!
But to return to the archery.&mdash;The gentlemen
were not so successful as the ladies: Miss
Campion sped her arrow right through the
centre of the target, and claimed a victory,
which her mother, who came within half an inch
of the bull’s eye, refused to admit, demanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to be queen herself, and awarding only the
second prize to her daughter. An altercation
ensued, and the angry looks, the unkind
taunts which I witnessed, live still in my
memory.</p>

<p>Matters grew so serious, that Mr. Otway proposed
lots: Lady Campion drew the longest,
and darting a look of fire at her rival, was
crowned by Lord Thornborough, whom she in
turn <i>voted</i> to be winner in the teeth of justice
and truth; and, after having reciprocally distinguished
him by a wreath of Fame, caught
him by the hand, and triumphantly led the way
towards a fine Grecian temple in the grounds,
where a magnificent collation was prepared, and
where the <i>pseudo</i> king and queen occupied a
throne of scarlet and gold, decorated with
laurels; while the rightful monarchs had not
even the satisfaction of <i>mingling</i> their complaints,
as the <i>real</i> hero was a sweet young
midshipman, son to Mrs. Fraser, who laughed
heartily at being <i>choused</i>, as he said, out of his
conquest, and who seemed of much too noble a
stamp to kneel at the feet of a haughty <i>regina</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
who, though herself mortified, treated him with
<i>sovereign</i> contempt.</p>

<p>While we were seated at a table covered with
refreshments, one of the Misses Campion asked
me, so suddenly, the ridiculous question, “Have
you been out yet?” that though I have heard
that it is the <i>technical</i> phrase for being presented
in the world, the more familiar meaning occurred
to my mind, and, like an idiot, I answered,
that I should think a walk round the grounds
very pleasant. A loud and rude burst of laughter
drew the attention of the company upon me,
and would have overwhelmed me with confusion,
if Mr. Bolton, who was sitting between
me and my tormentor, had not, with the celerity
of an arrow, upset a flask of Champagne
into the lap of the fair follower of Diana, which
produced such a prompt metamorphosis, as
“turned the green one red” in an instant, and
the laugh against her from me. The thing was
done so adroitly, that it appeared accidental,
and as no one was more busy than the <i>perpetrator</i>
in offering the most gallant commiseration,
I never knew till two days after that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
thus indebted in a third instance to my faithful
knight.</p>

<p>We adjourned presently to a music-room,
where harp and piano-forte, with all “means
and appliances to boot,” challenged competition
in a new form; and here another sad scene was
exhibited. A charming Italian duet was asked
for by Lord Thornborough, and Miss Campion,
who was in the habit of singing the
second, was called very authoritively by her
mother to take her part: she was also to accompany
on the piano-forte. With a cheerful alacrity
which delighted me, as evincing, I thought,
a sweet forgiving temper, she took her seat at
the instrument; but the harmony was soon disturbed,
for she had no sooner <i>landed</i> her mother
in a solo recitative, which the latter was
singing to admiration, than, jumping up, overturning
the music-desk, and rushing towards a
window, she exclaimed, “Look at the eagle!”
The company followed; and a crow, which had
crossed the house, and was picking up worms
in the lawn, was the only winged animal that
presented itself to view. Peals of unmeaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
laughter succeeded. Lady Campion was outrageous,
and could scarcely preserve an appearance
of decency; but as I felt how very
irritating her daughter <i>intended</i> to be, I begged
Mrs. and Miss Fraser to come and make
a little party at her side. We entreated her to
excuse Miss Campion’s mistake, and to indulge
us with a repetition of the delightful air
in which she had been interrupted.</p>

<p>After much disquietude, matters were arranged
once more, and the solo was achieved;
but in the midst of the concluding movement,
which was very brilliant, and calculated to make
a striking impression in the winding up, Miss
Campion uttered a piercing shriek, the effect of
which was ludicrous in the extreme, mingling as it
did with the full harmony, and vociferated, “a
bee, a bee!” and a bee there certainly <i>was</i>,
crawling up the leg of the piano-forte, so weak
and so drowsy after the cold weather, that the
last of its <i>intentions</i>, poor thing, seemed to be to
inflict the slightest injury on any one. Frederick
put the obnoxious insect out of the window,
but Lady Campion was now inexorable: she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
lost all control over looks and manner, which
seemed to affect every one, except the person
to whom they were directed; and, quite shocked
by the scene, I requested that we might take
our departure, which we did without delay,
leaving such a domestic <i>broil</i> as I had then
witnessed for the first time, to cool as it might.</p>

<p>Lord Thornborough handed me to the carriage,
and with an unfeeling “Hah! hah!
hah!” said, Miss Douglas, “you have come in
for a thunder-storm to-day. Her ladyship was
rather sublime; don’t you think so?” I was
too much disgusted to reply, and, contenting
myself with a passing bow, was happy to find
myself on the high road to Marsden.</p>

<p>Am I sure that my senses do not deceive
me, and that such things are? Is the
sacred relationship of parent and child <i>out of
fashion</i>? And is it possible, that while a daughter
forgets the respect due to a mother, mothers
have forgotten to respect themselves? I am
not surprised now, when I hear Mr. Otway and
Mr. Bolton speak of the present <i>times</i>, and compare
them with the period immediately preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the Revolution in France. I heard them agree
a day or two ago in drawing the parallel with
mournful fidelity, and finding in the frightful
demoralization of continental manners, which is
making, they said, rapid progress in these
countries, but too certain a prognostic of the
fate that will follow, if the tide be not arrested,
of which there seems but little hope.</p>

<p>If I had staid at home I should never have
known these things; and however one may detest,
I do not feel that we can become familiar
with what is wrong, without being the worse
for it.</p>

<p>In two days after Lady Campion’s <i>popping-jay</i>,
we were forced by my uncle to attend an
evening party at Lady Neville’s. It is not
more than two months since she has lost a beautiful
and accomplished daughter, who died of
decline. If <i>my</i> beloved mother had hung over
the dying couch of a child, would <i>she</i>&mdash;&mdash;but I
must curb myself, and <i>relate</i> facts, not <i>comment</i>
upon them, or I shall never have done. Till
ten o’clock at night we did not go to Neville
Court, though the cards particularly notified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
“an early party;” and when we reached that
splendid mansion, we found an immense assemblage
of the <i>beau monde</i>, greater than it was possible
to suppose could be mustered at such a
distance from London which is the focus of
all fashionable rays, a few of which only are
scattered and refracted by various accidents
in certain individual families, as cracks in a
glass will disturb the transmission of the sun’s
beams. <i>Here</i> was another <i>lie direct</i>, for the
cards also informed us, that the party was to be
a “<i>small</i>” one. Why this perversion of language?
I cannot fathom it. If some lurking
remnant of compunctious feeling crossed the
heart of Lady Neville; and in the words
“small” and “early” she discovered a slight
palliation of the offence against decency (for I
will not profane the sweet idea of maternal love
by using its language in <i>such</i> company), which
she had determined on committing, I should perceive
the reason of the strange deception of which
I am speaking, but all was gaiety and glitter.
Lady Neville and her daughters sparkled with
diamonds arranged upon a sort of gossamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
drapery, so light, so graceful, so artificially adjusted,
fashionable and becoming, that mourning
was the last sentiment which such paraphernalia
could excite or indicate. Their dress
told lies as well as their cards.</p>

<p>The house at Neville Court is superb, and as
I wandered from room to room with the amiable
Frasers and my own Charlotte, I felt the luxury
of kindred sentiment in a <i>new world</i>, and gave
free course to thoughts that were little in unison
with the passing scene. I fancied this magnificent
ball-room, with its chandeliers, its lustres,
and chalked floor, two short months ago, <i>perhaps</i>,
the theatre of <i>another</i> sort of assembly. I
marked the spot where, in imagination, I could
descry the lonely tressels supporting their sad
and youthful burthen&mdash;&mdash;that opening flower untimely
torn from its stalk, and snatched from
the warm hopes of unfolding spring. I beheld
the mutes, and saw the tables spread with funeral
fare; the “cold baked meats” of death; the
sable hangings; the hirelings of office, marshalling
their dismal train, at least with <i>features
screwed</i> to the occasion, and <i>voices</i> subdued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
whisper. With the most painful feelings I asked
within myself, “must we fly from the fondest ties
of nature, to seek for sorrow in ‘those chambers
of imagery supplied from the undertaker’s mercenary
taste;’ and fail to find it enshrined within
the breast of a mother or a sister?” My cheek
<i>curdled</i>, and my breathing became oppressed,
while these melancholy phantoms glided past
my mental vision, and like spectres mingled in
the dance. The brilliant ball-room seemed to
me no other than Holbein’s “dance of Death;”
and when I was roused from my reverie by,
“Miss Douglas, will you <i>daunce</i>?” let slip, as
if from the mouth of one just dropping asleep,
whose muscles had become too flaccid to retain
the words within its lips any longer, I started as
if I had been shot by one of Lady Campion’s
arrows, and turned round upon&mdash;Mr. Johnson.
Though I delight in dancing, there was too
much lead at my heart to allow of merriment in
my feet at this moment; and I therefore instinctively
declined, and for a time got rid of the
consummate puppyism of this disagreeable young
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>To my utter astonishment I was asked to join
in the next quadrille by Lord Thornborough,
whose politeness I should not have supposed
from any thing else I had witnessed, could have
induced the remembrance of a country lass, and
a stranger (though the latter is the highest claim
to attention in my dear Ireland), amidst such
dazzling beauty and attraction as solicited his
regards. You see I did him injustice, and am
ready to make the <i>amende honorable</i>; but as I
had refused Mr. Johnson, I could not dance
with any one else, and though I did not regret
this circumstance from any admiration of <i>milord</i>,
I confess to having found it difficult to sit still,
when the gloomy contemplations with which the
evening commenced, began to yield to the inspiring
influence of lively music. I had, however,
the great pleasure of seeing Charlotte enjoying
a gratification which was denied to me;
and, would you believe it, she had scarcely begun
to move, when a crowd was collected to see her
dance. Her figure is so like what one imagines
of a Sylph, and her ear is so perfect, that to admire
her performance in a quadrille, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
appear nothing more than the necessary routine
of cause and effect, if I had not believed the
group by which we were surrounded quite too
artificial in its construction to leave a corner for
nature to slide in at. However, so it was, that
I heard several of the gentlemen express their
approbation in terms more energetic than I
should have thought such indolent looking people
likely to employ on any occasion, <i>even</i> of
the moment; and dear unconscious Charlotte
seemed for a time <i>Reine de la fête</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Bolton, who came to sit by
me for a little while, “<i>there</i> is the triumph of
truth and native grace over all the contrivances
of fashion. There is your sister, who has never
seen London or Paris, bearing away the palm
from all those painted dolls who are swinging
their persons round the room.”</p>

<p>Quadrilles ended, how shall I express my
feelings at seeing Lady Campion and Lord
Thornborough get up to waltz! Timanthes, a
painter of ancient times, drew a veil over the
face of a father whose grief he felt unequal to
pourtray. I must borrow his device, and let a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
curtain fall over an exhibition which I wish
obliterated from my memory. I found a few
lines by Frederick, which he wrote in London,
after returning from a ball, part of the concluding
stanza of which shall finish my descant upon
this distasteful theme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But there is something in a waltz which wears</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Off all the lovely bloom of virgin grace,</div>
<div class="verse">When round Belinda’s form a stranger dares</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Fling the unhallowed arm in bold embrace,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And rudely gazes on her beauteous face.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dancing wanted that <i>gaieté du cœur</i> which
alone renders it an agreeable and animating
amusement. The ladies glided like silver eels,
and the gentlemen groped about the room as if
their eyes were shut, so that absolutely, if a
stranger had been introduced, who never saw a
modern ball-room before, he might have been
excused for imagining that the dancers were
playing blind man’s buff, and afraid of knocking
their heads against the panels, if they moved their
bodies without the utmost circumspection. In
short, a child of nature would wonder why people
should take the trouble of submitting their feet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a sort of <i>rhythm</i> just enough to shackle their freedom,
and prevent the luxury of perfect inanition.
Well, thought I to myself, this society is
<i>fashionable</i>. These men and women move in
what is called the first circle. The former will,
many of them, become our Members of Parliament;
senators, by whose collective wisdom we
are to be directed. These asses in human form,
the most idle, ignorant, effeminate animals possible
to conceive, are to be husbands, fathers,
landlords, masters! It is a melancholy prospect,
and in looking to my own sex, on thoughts
of which my mind from infancy has dwelt with
pride and pleasure, as the sweet depository of
religion, morals, fond affections, taste and talents
softened down to social converse, and illuminating
the domestic sphere, oh, what a contrast
meets my eye! what will these creatures
be when all that art can do to whiten the poor
sepulchre shall fail, and wrinkles insurmountable
<i>will</i> raise their fearful lines of circumvalation
round the once bright orbs? when rouge itself,
the last faithful handmaid of departing beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
no longer sticks to the haggard cheek, no longer
lights up the extinguished eye; when the ethereal
form of finished symmetry is either swelled
to the mountain size of those round matrons
who in vain would try to grasp the pedal harp
which shuns the corpulent embrace, or dwindled
to the bony frame which only serves for draperies
to be hung upon? What will be the fate
of these hapless wrecks of vanished youth,
when even cards, the ultimate resource of age,
the last strong hold of veteran nothingness, shall
cease to charm? Oh, my Julia, how will these miserable
beings tremble, as the grave yawns beneath
their feet! Eternity awaits all these butterflies,
whether male or female; and I shudder, as imagination
presents the grisly group of coxcombs,
and of belles, stripped of their paint and patches,
wigs, and waltzes, and standing to receive the
final sentence at an Almighty tribunal.</p>

<p>I was interrupted in my <i>sermon</i> by a call to
the library. It was to meet our new chaplain,
for whom my uncle promised to provide, when
he procured the appointment of Mr. Oliphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to the parish of Glenalta; and what words
can describe our joy at finding in this young
man, no other than your neighbour and intimate
friend, Alfred Stanley. A person with
whom we all feel so well acquainted, and have
such reason, through your dear aunt’s eloquent
sketches of his character, to admire and value
without having ever seen him till now.</p>

<p>Mamma, you know of old, loves to play us
a little trick sometimes; and in the present
instance I find that all the Checkley family
have been in league with her to surprise us.
Judge then of our astonishment at receiving
your packet by Mr. Stanley, whose groom
returns to-morrow into Derbyshire, and shall
take this <i>volume</i> to you.</p>

<p>A few days now will see us <i>en route</i>. I cannot
hope to send you more than a <i>line</i> till I
reach Paris.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest Julia; I would that we had
done with towns, and were safely arrived in
that beautiful region where the mighty “Alps
have reared a throne” worthy of those skies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
which gild their everlasting snows with refulgent
glory.</p>

<p>A thousand loves attend you all.</p>

<p class="center">Ever your affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Emily Douglas</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Oliphant to Mr. Otway.</span></h2>

<p>To you, my dear friend, I address myself
upon the present occasion, though gratitude
has long ere this, dictated a return of my best
acknowledgments to Mrs. Douglas, for <i>two</i> such
letters as deserve indeed my heart-felt thanks.
But I have been painfully occupied, and I leave
to your discretion the time and method of
explaining to my dear friend, the cause of my
silence, which is no other than the death of our
worthy and much lamented neighbour Mr.
Bentley, an event, intelligence of which, I well
know, will not be heard at Marsden with indifference.
A fortnight ago he returned, as
usual, from his ride, accompanied by George,
and immediately on entering the house, fell into <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>a
sort of fit, which appeared to result from determination
of blood towards the head. George
sent directly for me, and we had Mr. Pigot immediately
from Tralee, who acted with judgment,
and ere the surgeon and physician, for
whom we sent to Dublin, had reached Mount
Prospect, our poor friend had recovered his
sensibility. The devotion of George to his
uncle could not be exceeded, and it was so
purely disinterested, that the wealth of Potosi
would have weighed but as a feather in the balance,
against the re-establishment of Mr. Bentley’s
health. The medical people, however,
saw from the first, that his situation was precarious,
of which he was conscious from the
beginning himself. With Christian courage, he
began to prepare for the awful change which he
perceived to be approaching, and truly died the
death of the righteous. Yesterday evening he
breathed his last in the arms of his nephew. I
never left him, except for the necessary purposes
of refreshment, from the time of his first
seizure, and have the happiness of believing
that my presence afforded him comfort. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
short period of his indisposition spared him any
great exhaustion of strength, he spoke without
uneasiness, and in the most collected manner
adverted to the nature of his hopes. Nothing
could be more deeply interesting than his discourse,
during the few latter hours which preceded
the closing scene.</p>

<p>“Oliphant,” said he, “I have never in my
life, been an unbeliever; but how small is the
difference between infidelity, and a mere nominal
Christianity: a meagre religion of form and
habit! Nay, of the two, is there not a better
chance, that the avowed scoffer, terrified by the
abyss which lies before him, may turn from the
evil of his ways, than the self-satisfied moralist,
who depends on his miserable, his imperfect
works, for eternal salvation? My friend, I was
in the latter predicament. I received a commonplace
Church of England education, said
my prayers mechanically, went to church, gave
alms, abstained from travelling on Sundays;
and was for years of my life, so entirely persuaded,
that as a Christian character, I stood
on a high pedestal, removed from the vulgar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
level of mankind, that the Pharisee’s words,
though not perhaps actually expressed by my
lips, were never far from my heart; and, ‘Lord,
I thank Thee, that I am not as other men,’
was a sentiment continually present to me,
whenever I thought upon serious subjects. Oh,
how far from God was I in those days, when I
thought myself so near Him!”</p>

<p>Here he paused, and after the interval of a
few minutes, resumed the train of solemn reflection
upon which he had entered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added he, “blessed be Heaven, such
vain-glorious delusions are far from me now,
and I am not ashamed to say, that I owe the
change to this young man.”</p>

<p>Here poor George was completely overwhelmed.
He pressed his uncle’s hand to his
lips, and shed a torrent of tears.</p>

<p>“George,” continued the dying man, “first
taught me the religion of the heart. Of what
avail are the cold conclusions of reason? they
teach not humility, they do not subdue the passions,
they do not improve the temper, nor allay
one demoniac ebullition of malice or revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
My practice has been wretchedly vacillating. I
have been continually led away from the right
way; but it is something to know this, and to
put no confidence in aught but the redeeming
mercy of Him who suffered in our mortal form,
for guilty man, and died upon the cross to save
our souls alive.”</p>

<p>My poor friend told me that his worldly
affairs were all settled.</p>

<p>“My temporal house,” said he, “has been
set in order. May the heavenly mansions be
opened to receive me!”</p>

<p>From time to time, he held this kind of language,
placidly awaiting the awful mandate.
The bursting of a blood vessel in the temple is
not attended by much pain, and he suffered
none that was not incident to the remedies employed.
On Tuesday he gave me a key, and
told me where I should find all his papers regularly
labelled, adding, “George’s character is
not one of shew. He will be sorry for me in
the bottom of his heart: give him assistance
now, and he will not need it long. Religion
has taken fast hold upon him, and her consolations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
will quickly restore the equilibrium of his
spirits. He will never <i>forget</i>, but he will soon
cease to <i>grieve</i>.”</p>

<p>After so saying, he fell into a tranquil slumber,
and spoke no more, except to ask for certain
portions of the sacred volume. He repeated
the 15th chapter of St. John with fervour;
desired us to read the 53d of Isaiah, the 23d
Psalm, and other favourite parts of scripture.
A restless night proclaimed the approach of
death, and the last afternoon witnessed his
peaceful exit. He left his affectionate regards
for all of you, and has bequeathed, he told me,
some little memorial of respectful esteem to
each individual at Glenalta and Lisfarne.</p>

<p>Thus has passed away our kind-hearted neighbour
Roger Bentley, and his loss would be
too sad to dwell upon, if his excellent nephew
were not heir to his uncle’s virtues, as well as
property. No change will be felt, I venture to
assert, by any one who depended on the bounty
of our departed friend. Poor George is absorbed
in silent sorrow; he neither weeps nor
talks, but the chalky paleness of his countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
is a faithful index to what passes within.
He courts solitude, and wishes no other companionship
than his Bible. When the last ceremony
is performed, I shall write to my dear
friend, Mrs. Douglas, and in the mean time,
with the most affectionate remembrances to her,
the General, and <i>my pupils</i>, believe me, my
dear sir,</p>

<p class="center">Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">J. Oliphant</span>.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">From Edward Otway, Esq. to Rev. Mr. Oliphant.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">My dear Oliphant,</p>

<p>I cannot describe the shock which your intelligence
imparted. It was but a week before
that day, on which his final summons was issued,
that I received a letter from my valued
and lamented friend, full of project and futurity;
warm with friendship, and seasoned with
that peculiar and pungent humour which rendered
him so singularly entertaining and lively
a companion. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi!</i> In
middle age, rich, healthy, divested of care, and
happy in the society of that good young man,
who would have thought the end so near?
Who could have anticipated this sudden wreck
of human hope? Such is life! And does not
such a tragedy, as it often presents, call upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the actors in the drama for serious thoughts of
what may follow? I will not say that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We could have better spared a better man,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>for Bentley was an excellent character, but I
may truly say, that many who fill a much larger
circle than he did in the world’s estimation,
would not have left such a chasm in society.
To the poor, his loss would be irreparable,
were it not that he leaves in George a representative
so worthy of him. Oh! when I reflect
upon the habit which prevails so generally at
present, of taking young people abroad, educating
them in distant climes, alienating their
minds from the land that gave them birth, and
forming their tastes to foreign manners; when
I compare this dismal error, and its consequences,
with the scene which we are contemplating
at Mount Prospect, surely there is reason
to apprehend a fatal overthrow for our hapless
country. How few George Bentleys are
ready to succeed the present generation amongst
us! I have seen much of the world in <i>my day</i>,
but have latterly lived in such abstraction from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
its vices and its follies, that they strike me with
almost as much wonder in their modern dress,
as if I had not before been familiar with their
features. True it is, that they are to be found
everywhere, and the deepest retirement is not
necessarily virtuous, <i>because</i> it is solitary; but
the fashionable community of the present day
seems to “out-Herod Herod” in all that
marks the absence of head and heart. These
dear young people are quite an affecting study.
I never saw such purity in mortal mould as
breathes around them. Each seems to be provided
by nature with a <i>safety lamp</i> that preserves
them from contact with the noxious
miasma of a vicious world; and I should be repaid
for much greater dereliction from my usual
habits than I submit to here, by the pleasure
which I derive from the unsophisticated singleness,
instinctive modesty, and fine feeling of
my youthful associates, to whom it has fallen to
my lot to act the part of <i>Chaperone</i>. Never had
<i>Duenna</i> reason to be prouder of a trust than I
have of the charge confided to my care; and
my vanity has cause of excitement in full proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with my pride, as the charm of nature
in the midst of an artificial society is irresistibly
refreshing, like the admittance of Heaven’s
sweet breath, the pure mountain breeze, into a
heated atmosphere, loaded with the costly, but
insalubrious exhalation of a thousand perfumes.
<i>You</i> are so much a part of the Glenalta family,
through the claims of a long acquaintance and
mutual regard, that I do not feel as if I were
betraying the delicacy of my young friend
Emily Douglas, in telling you of the proof
which we have just received of her total indifference
to rank and fortune. Two days ago,
General Douglas was applied to <i>in form</i> on the
part of an old Baronet in this neighbourhood,
who requested permission to announce his only
son in quality of suitor to his niece, promising
that nothing should be wanting in the liberality
of settlements to render the proposed alliance
agreeable to the young lady and her mother.
I need scarcely add, how unhesitatingly these
advances were rejected. <i>You</i> are too well
acquainted with the charming girl who was the
object of them, to doubt her reception of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
an offer. Emily’s hand will <i>follow</i> her heart,
<i>not</i> precede it; and happy will he be for whom
such a treasure may be destined.</p>

<p>When a favourable moment occurs, and that
you find dear George capable of deriving pleasure
from hearing of a tribute to his uncle’s
memory, tell him, that all the gaieties of a
week, in prospect, have been suspended at
Marsden by the young people, as a mark of the
sincere esteem in which our late friend was
held by the inhabitants of Glenalta. Adieu, my
dear Oliphant. All here unite in kindest remembrances
with</p>

<p class="center">Your faithful and affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Ed. Otway</span>.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Emily Douglas to Julia Sandford.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Brighton.</i></p>

<p>Here we are, dearest Julia, and, as I find
that we are to stay here for some days, I cannot
employ myself more agreeably than in writing
you “a few more last words” ere we embark
for the Continent. But I must carry you
back to Marsden, where we remained full three
weeks after the period which had been fixed
upon for our departure, on account of the fluctuations
in my uncle’s health. The day after I
sent you my last letter, we received the sad
news from Glenalta, which mamma conveyed to
Checkley. Till we lost dear Mr. Bentley, I
had no idea how much we all loved him; and I
feel that his death has left a cruel blank in our
social circle. The intelligence of an event so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
painful, naturally restrained the course of our
amusement, if that deserve the name which
owes to the weakness of our fellow creatures its
whole power of affording entertainment. I am
such a novice in the ways of <i>polite</i> life, that I
have not yet learned to laugh at the people
around me, without something of self-reproach,
which sends me to my pillow in an uneasy
state of mind, that “murders sleep;” and
I was growing very weary of what is so
falsely, in my opinion, called pleasure, when
Mr. Oliphant’s melancholy letter occasioned a
complete cessation of dinner and evening parties,
so far as <i>we</i> were concerned. We had no
spirits to join the insipid society of the neighbourhood,
when our minds were transplanted
to the awful scene at Mount Prospect. During
several days we did not stir from the demesne
of Marsden, and these, if not clouded by the
death of our kind neighbour, would have been
by far the happiest that I have passed since we
left <i>home</i>&mdash;talismanic word, which I never write,
nor speak, without an emotion peculiar to itself.
We are greatly delighted with your friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Alfred Stanley. What a heavenly sight is that
of a young heart devoted to its God? Mr.
Stanley is, <i>indeed</i>, a clergyman, and his life and
manners explain that text of Scripture so often
cavilled at, which beautifully provides at once
for the purity of the Apostle and the utility of
his example, in the injunction to come out of
the world; <i>yet</i>, while avoiding its contagion,
not to mistake a local removal, or a cold abstraction
from its concerns, for that holiness
which the Great Founder of our religion urges
on his followers. Mr. Stanley is a practical
illustration of the precept intended, I am convinced,
to be understood, as he enacts it.&mdash;Cheerful,
elegant, informed, and pleasing, there
is no society which is not rendered more agreeable
by his presence; but there is none in which
it would be possible to forget his sacred calling.
Religion seems to have its rise in the centre of
his heart, and to send forth streams into every
action; yet not such as dash and foam, and startle
by their impetuosity, but the existence of
which, within the soil, is discovered from the
verdure and fertility of the surface. His opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
seem, as far as I can judge in a short
time, to be purely those of Gospel truth, equally
remote from the lifeless formalism of what is
now, by a strange and melancholy distinction,
designated <i>Orthodoxy</i>; and, on the other side,
those peculiar tenets so seldom honestly avowed,
but sometimes defacing the Christian scheme,
which derive their name and character from
Geneva. Your friend, Alfred, realizes my
idea of a faithful messenger. His piety is evangelical,
but he is not a <i>Calvinist</i>&mdash;he is&mdash;what
was I going to say? I had just begun a sentence
when Fanny came flying into my room to
tell me that the packet which sails on Monday
is to waft us from the British shores. My
uncle, it appears also, has received a letter
stating, that the repairs of the parish church at
Swainton, where Mr. Stanley is to officiate,
cannot be completed under three months. In
consequence of this intelligence, a warm invitation
to accompany us on the Continent has
been made and accepted; so we shall take our
<i>chaplain</i> with us, and I have no doubt that we
shall find him a great acquisition to our party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
The concluding week of our sojournment at
Marsden was marked by some extraordinary
events. Sir Christopher Cromie, the most pudding-headed
puffin that ever was destined to
take his seat in the House of Commons, has
now the privilege of franking in such a <i>claw</i>&mdash;for
hand-writing you cannot call it&mdash;that if he
should doze away, per force of segars, the recollection
of his own name, as I have been assured
that a gentleman, equally enlightened with our
baronet, once did, Sir Christopher’s autograph
has this advantage over all others, that it may
stand for any, or for every thing, according to
the skill employed in deciphering his pot-hooks
and hangers. He was duly returned&mdash;chaired&mdash;feasted;
and gave a foretaste of his Parliamentary
eloquence at a great election “<i>feed</i>,”
as Mr. Bolton told us, in a speech which,
though evidently conned over long before it
was spoken, proved such a desperate failure,
that even the newspaper editor in his pay could
not tack <i>any</i> epithet more flattering than
“<i>neat</i>” to Sir Kit’s address to his constituents.
Quere, may not this word <i>neat</i>, applied to gentlemen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
harangues, which are neither sensible,
witty, eloquent, nor impressive, be a delicate
cover for&mdash;<i>calf</i>? Well, shouts rent the air,
and the sweet sounds of “Sir Christopher for
ever!” struck upon the listening organs of Mrs.
Hannaper, who was seated in a balcony of the
Red Lion inn, glowing like a Chinese poppy,
and surrounded with her attendant nymphs,
though certainly very unlike Calypso herself,
awaiting the happy moment of victory to buff
and blue. No sooner did the glad tidings
reach the portals of her ear, than Mrs. Hannaper,
with her plumed hat in one hand, and
a white handkerchief in the other, cheered the
populace. A shower of silver next bestrewed
the pavement. Tar barrels, beer barrels, and
all the usual vulgarities of <i>mobbish</i> demonstration,
had their turn, and the tables at Parham
Hall groaned under the hecatomb sacrificed
that day to this new pillar of the Constitution,
this swollen, shining faced, addle pated, member
of the British Senate, duly elected to represent
that <i>goodly</i> portion of the British empire;
the ale-steeped suffrages of which gave him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
trifling majority over a sensible, worthy man,
who was his opponent, and committed its interests
to the head of one who would never
have made the troublesome discovery through
any appeal to his judgment, that he had a head
at all on his shoulders, if it had not been for a
reference once submitted to his fiat, to decide
between the rival merits of unadulterated Lundy
Foot, and the Duke of York’s mixture. On
the evening of that auspicious day, Mrs. Hannaper,
wound up to the highest height of generous
enthusiasm, took her niece aside, and just
as the dancing was about to commence, presented
her with a power of attorney, duly executed
to her agents in London, and enabling
them to transfer £20,000 from her name
to that of Miss Ormsby, in the New Four
per Cents, saying, as she slipped the paper into
her niece’s hand, “we do not know what is before
us; this is a day of rejoicing, and you shall
have your share in it. Here I have made you
independent, and you may please yourself in
the choice of a husband.” Little did the poor
lady dream of what she was about, nor guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the prompt obedience of Miss Ormsby in adopting
her aunt’s suggestion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hannaper retired from the revels worn
out with fatigue at twelve o’clock; but when
Sol, drawing aside the golden curtains of the
east, ventured to peep within the crimson hangings
of Mrs. Hannaper’s pavilion, Sir Christopher
Cromie and the fair Ormsby were dashing
away towards London, carrying safely with
them those credentials which, on their being presented
at the Bank of England, put the young
lady in possession of her fortune, and by so
doing, <i>kicked the beam</i>, and sent poor Hannaper
up in her scale, which had previously been
kept by the pressure of her purse in trembling
balance with its partner, in which Miss Ormsby’s
beauty weighed but unsteadily against it.
Words are inadequate to paint the surprise,
rage, and disappointment which alternately
struggled, and then burst all in a <i>mess</i> together
from the lips of our heroine. After the first
explosion was over, the spirit of intrigue raised
its head over the troubled waters, and, re-asserting
its wonted pre-eminence, suggested the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of a glorious revenge, in setting aside Sir Christopher’s
election, on the ground of bribery and
corruption, most abundant proof of which, Mrs
Hannaper was able to command, her own diminished
caskets having chiefly supplied the
sinews of the war, and bearing testimony to the
truth of that plea, on which it is now her object
to humble the god of her <i>whilom</i> idolatry. If
she is able to succeed, it is imagined that she
has two strings to her bow, as a corps of reserve,
either to bring forward an old East
Indian, who has a fine place in her neighbourhood
for the borough of Jobton, and marry
him out of spite to Sir Kit; or, to set up a
numskull nephew, who sold out of the guards
some time ago, and has been since trying to
barter a fine figure for a heavy purse. It is
thought that with <i>M. P.</i> gracefully appended
to his name, he might prevail on Lady Florence
Languish, to accept his hand upon a life insurance,
and certain reversionary hopes connected
with Parham Hall, in which case, Mrs. Hannaper
will make him heir, and cut out her
niece’s farther expectations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Julia, what abominations have I been
describing! This narrative, as I have given it
to you, is as nearly as I can remember, in the
very words of Mr. Bolton, our merry chronicler;
and <i>this</i> was the mystery, to which he
alluded, when he hinted at <i>back stairs</i> intelligence,
but refused to explain farther, lest we
should mar poetic justice, by revealing the plot.
Alas! I have worse than this to tell you, and
then my pen shall never be dipped again in
subjects such as these. It is not good to talk,
to write, to think on themes of this nature;
were they simply disgusting, they would not be
dangerous; but it is not in human nature to resist
the ridiculous when Mr. Bolton is the Biographer,
and such people as I have been introducing
to your acquaintance are the subjects of a
memoir compiled by him. I laughed till the
tears made channels in my cheeks. Not so,
when he told us a story of another neighbour,
whose house I have <i>journalized</i> you into visiting
along with me. Only conceive Lady Campion’s
having made proposals of marriage to
Lord Thornborough, who had, after too liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a potation of Burgundy, made <i>his</i> to her daughter;
and preparations are actually in train for
this unnatural union, Lord T. having deserted
his first love. The contemptible animal, miscalled
<i>nobleman</i>, has made his terms: Lady
Campion settles a thousand a-year upon him in
perpetuity, of which she deprives her own offspring,
and receives a coronet in exchange!
Thank heaven that we have left Marsden, the
air of which seems tainted by such corruption.</p>

<p>Before I close my letter I must refresh myself,
and obey you, by looking into Frederick’s
humourous diary, and trying whether I
can give you another scrap out of it in the way
of <i>a vignette</i>. I told you the dear fellow
diverted himself by scribbling in verse, when he
reached his lodgings at night, rehearsing for
his diversion the principal circumstances that
had struck him ludicrously in the course of each
day, while in London. I find a ball at Lady
Gosling’s mentioned in the three following
stanzas, which are a good specimen of Frederick’s
merry vein:&mdash;</p>

<p>I bid adieu to sarcasm here, and must not

purify myself by bathing in the Pelice, before I
presume to penetrate farther into those enchanting
regions of nature and simplicity.
What have Mrs. Hannaper and Lady Campion
in common with the glorious Alps? I wish that
I had never seen or heard of them.</p>

<p>This Brighton is not worth a sketch; a
meagre strand, a barren flat, dressed up indeed,
and frequented as the seat of majesty. But the
palace here is no better than a <i>wart</i>, a mere
excrescence without either grace or beauty,
bereft of all that constitutes grandeur, or
excites an idea of tasteful feeling <i>without</i>, and
<i>within</i> seeming like a mighty store-house, in
which all sorts of splendid things from east,
west, north, and south, are accumulated, as in
a great bazaar. I wonder that the king did not
grow weary of its dull monotony long ago.
My uncle, dear soul, is much less well than
he was a month ago, and I grow impatient till
we arrive at Turin, in <i>hope</i>, (oh, what a desert
would this world be but for its sweet influence),
that change of climate may effect some happy
alteration. Mamma has been employing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
her rhetoric in vain, to persuade him into passing
on at once to our destination, but he <i>will</i>
halt in Paris, that we may gaze upon its wonders.
Once more adieu. Wish us a fair wind
and quick passage, dearest Julia, and with love
to all <i>you</i> love, believe me, till death, your
affectionate</p>

<h2>LETTER XL.<br />
<span class="smcap">Frederick Douglas to the Rev. Mr. Oliphant.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Paris.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear Friend,</p>

<p>The first fruits of my pen in a foreign
land, shall be dedicated to you. Though you
have only travelled by the fire-side, there is not
any thing in the route that we are to trace
which could afford you the slightest pleasure
from its novelty. The appearance of Dieppe,
the country, the posting, Rouen, the windings
of the Seine, the chateaux, what is there that I
have yet seen, which is not as familiar to you in
description, as the map of Dublin? We left
Brighton on Monday, and I felt as I took a
farewell view of Beachy-head, an undefined
sensation, which I dare say that thousands have
felt before me, compounded of pride, pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and sorrow. To go <i>abroad</i>, though become so
common, that the difficulty is to find any one
now who stays at home, has something in the
very sound of the words inspiring to one’s
spirits; a vague hope of adventure, a sort of
self-applause at having commenced an enterprise;
and a kind of nameless triumph in touching
a foreign shore, and finding oneself understood
when speaking a strange tongue; all these
circumstances elevate the mind to enthusiasm,
while the parting pang on quitting home, country,
friends, though but for a limited season,
must chequer the gladness of any heart, in whatever
breast it may reside. I wish for your company
always, but I particularly desired to have
you at my elbow when I passed St. Germain en
Laye, Rosni, and Malmaison. What a crowd
of recollections rushed upon my mind, as Sully,
Louis the Fourteenth, Madame de Maintenon,
James the Second, and Napoleon, pressed upon
my thoughts, and struggled for a precedence,
which the different ages in which they played
their parts, arranged in an order very unlike
that in which they rose to my imagination; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
wonderful Corsican contriving generally to
jostle out every reminiscence that was not connected
with his astonishing appearance upon
earth.</p>

<p>I wanted you also at my side as we approached
Paris, the <i>coup d’œil</i> of which as you enter
the Place Louis Quinze is superb. In one
point of view the eye takes in, as if in an immense
panorama the entire circle of those objects
which at once exalt and degrade man,
exhibit his power, and prove his nothingness.
Palaces that have stood for ages, the great triumphal
pillar which records the conquests of
that preternatural chief who frowned the world
into fetters at his feet, then that spot where the
martyred Bourbons ascended the scaffold, where
that angel Elizabeth exchanged the horrors of
her prison for the crown of glory that awaited
such faith, such love, such heroism as her’s!
But whither is my pen straying? What is
there in Paris that you have not at your finger’s
ends? Aye, you could direct me to the very
shelf in the Royal Library on which any book
is placed which you desired to consult. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
could send me north, south, east, or west, in
the Jardin des Plantes for this, that, or the
other class of <i>Linnæus</i>. You could take a wand,
and, pointing to the pictures of the Louvre,
give me a history of every subject which they
exhibit, and name the master who executed
each. In short, the only thing which you at
this moment in the county of Kerry could not
describe much more accurately to me than I
to you is precisely that which no pen is capable
of conveying, namely, the direct impression
made upon the senses by the objects themselves;
and this is so exhilarating, that I seem to myself
to tread on air, and to breathe an atmosphere,
like that which Saussure found on the
summit of Mont Blanc, almost threatening delirium
by its rarefaction. How striking the difference
between history and fiction in the effects
produced upon the mind while we are visiting
the several theatres allotted to the drama of one
or the other! All the charms of association,
the powers of memory, the magic of imagination,
are called into vivid action as we take our
seat in a chair which had held Henry the Fourth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
or place ourselves at a table on which Sully
wrote; but when we look upon a Prior Park as
the seat of Mr. Allworthy, Tom Jones vanishes
from the scene, and we feel almost ashamed
when fictitious personages lay claim to any region
of the brain except that which is inhabited
by fancy. “Unreal mockery hence” is the sentiment
which I felt on viewing the scene of
Fielding’s tale, and being desired to mark the
wood, the pond, the garden, which are supposed
by the author to have witnessed the early
<i>squabbles</i> of Bliffield and the youthful hero. Is
not this an argument for keeping truth and fiction
separate?</p>

<p>With few exceptions, I hate historical novels,
which, losing the sobriety of fact, are equally
divested of the grace which attaches to invention,
and present all the whalebone and starch
of ruffs and farthingales without being faithful
to costume; thus producing a chaos in the
memory, and blending incidents and people
till we can no longer trace the line between substance
and shadow.</p>

<p>Emily is the pupil who does you most credit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Charlotte and Fanny are very intelligent, and
see their way so well, that if <i>Em.</i> were not of
our party, the others would perhaps astonish;
but old and young, we all flock to your <i>Pulcheria</i>,
as you have called her from her childhood,
to tell us whatever we want to know. Her memory
is so admirable that nothing seems <i>to run
through</i> it, and she has the whole story of every
thing that we see by heart, while, as you know,
she cannot imagine herself to be superior to any
one with whom she converses.</p>

<p>I must tell you, that nothing could exceed the
admiration which these amiable, unartificial
sisters of mine have excited in Hampshire.
How is it that people can relinquish all right
and title to understanding or good feeling, in
their <i>own</i> case, and yet retain enough of each
to admire both when they have met with them
in others?</p>

<p>I hope that George Bentley has received all
my letters, and that he may turn in his thoughts
the proposal which I made in my last, that he
should meet us at Turin. My uncle talks of
remaining here not less than a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Stanley improves upon us every day: he is a
very fine young man, and equally a favourite
with us all.</p>

<p>I am on the tip-toe of expectation till the post
comes in, which will decide whether Arthur and
his friend Falkland can come here. It will be
delightful if they can join us; and fortunately
our hotel is large enough for us to be all together.</p>

<p>Huzza!&mdash;They will be in Paris to-morrow
evening.&mdash;God bless you, my dear sir.&mdash;Love
to Lawrence.</p>

<h2>LETTER XLI.<br />
<span class="smcap">Emily Douglas to Julia Sandford.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">Dearest Julia,</p>

<p>Here we are, in that truly magnificent
street, the Rue Royale, to which we removed
immediately after I sent off my last letter.
From our hotel we look upon such a world of
<i>monuments</i>, that every object which the windows
open upon seems to beckon like a ghost, and
invite one to hear the tales which it could disclose;
but you lived so near this spot when you
were in Paris, that you can place yourself in the
midst of us, and accompany your friends in every
excursion.&mdash;I am bewildered! The beauty of
the buildings, the <i>foreign air</i> of all things
around me, the confusion of tongues, the quantity
to be seen and heard on the one hand; then
the anxiety which presses daily on our hearts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and mamma’s evident apprehension that <i>the end</i>
so much dreaded is not far distant, hang a
mill-stone round my neck and chequer every
enjoyment; but I have a great deal to tell you,
of one sort or other.</p>

<p>Here I broke off; my letter, only written thus
far, has lain by during upwards of a week.
Arthur and his friend are with us; and Time
flies on golden pinions. If happiness be not
made for mortals, why have we sometimes a
cup of such sparkling brilliancy presented to
our lips only to make us suffer the fate of
Tantalus? I am driven to ask this murmuring
discontented question on looking around,
and casting up the sum of such treasures as
I cannot bear to part with.</p>

<p>You know how we love Arthur, who is so
improved that I should scarcely know him;
and, oh, what a being is Charles Falkland!
It would seem as if Nature, in one of her
happiest moods, had sent him into our planet
just to shew what she was able to perform. I
had heard of him, and read his letters; I
therefore expected something unlike the average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of human kind, but I was not prepared for
such a creature as I find, who seems to have
been endowed at his birth by all the fairies,
who, according to the ancient legends, used to
subscribe “a virtue each, and each a grace,”
to produce perfection! I rejoice for Frederick
in such a companion; and as for the female
part of our circle, every enjoyment afforded by
the interminable delights of this surprising
Paris, is rendered tenfold attractive by the
society which it is our fortune to have assembled
here.</p>

<p>We passed two days at Versailles most agreeably,
and have been at St. Cloud. After all
my resolutions to the contrary, I should find
it impossible to avoid dilating on themes so
fruitful of reflection, were my mind not too
much taken up at present with thoughts that
corrode and distress, to admit of musing on
more abstract subjects.</p>

<p>Hardly is my dear Arthur happy in a reunion
with so many who are dear to him, ere
a fatal interruption occurs in a letter from
Louisa Howard, and a second from young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Annesley, dated Milan. The first informs
him that my aunt is seriously ill, and so harassed
by applications for money, both on her own
and her unfortunate son-in-law’s account, that
the most distressing consequences may be apprehended.</p>

<p>Poor Louisa writes in sad spirits, and entreats
her brother to lose as little time as possible
in setting out for Selby. Mr Annesley’s
letter brings the painful tidings that Lord
Crayton has had a quarrel with an officer, to
whom he had lost a large sum of money.
They fought; Lord C. killed his antagonist,
and then absconded: Lady Crayton accompanied
his flight. They left Milan deeply in
debt, and no one is able to trace the fugitives.
At this moment the family are in consultation
respecting what is to be done; and
before I close this, you shall hear the result
of the council.</p>

<p>Well, our much loved Arthur, who is greatly
depressed, sets out for Calais to-morrow; and
Mr. Falkland, who gives your friend Stanley
a seat in his carriage, has resolved on accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
us. We have outstayed the time
allotted to Paris, and are to commence our
journey in three or four days.</p>

<p>Adieu, dearest Julia!</p>

<h2>LETTER XLII.<br />
<span class="smcap">From the Same to the Same.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Turin.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dearest Julia,</p>

<p>Though it is not above a fortnight since I
closed my last letter, my life has latterly become
<i>so full</i>, that days, happily as they glide away,
seem to occupy years in their passage, when I
count the measure of their duration by the variety
of scene, the stimulus of movement, and
the excitement of mind, which I have to remember.</p>

<p>We left Paris on Thursday, and did not enter
the Forest of Fontainebleau till its majestic
shades were involved in twilight. No, never
while I have life, can I forget the emotions
which this scene, so noble in its solitude&mdash;so
melancholy&mdash;yet so romantic, excited in my
soul! The pensive drapery which approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
night cast over the venerable woods before us!
the magnificence of the single trees, which stood
out every now and then from the masses of
mingled rock and foliage, as if to exhibit all the
pride of individuality! the fantastic shapes of
hill and crag&mdash;the silence only broken by a
stream which murmured to the right of us as
we moved slowly forwards: and all this, contrasted
with the din of that noisy, vicious, and
idle multitude that we had left behind, struck
upon my heart an impression which, while
“memory holds her seat,” can never be obliterated.</p>

<p>I could have lingered for ever in the dreary,
yet beautiful Forest of Fontainebleau, regardless
of the present and future, so wrapped was I
in contemplation of the past. Henry the Great
rose upon my vision, and the horns seemed
to sound in my ear, that summoned him and
his brilliant cortege to the royal sports, of
which this splendid forest was the favourite
scene. The ghost of Bayard, dear to France,
and adored by all whose breasts own a sympathetic
spark of those glowing fires kindled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the spirit of chivalry, glided across my imagination;
but the images of grandeur, and the
phantoms of romance, soon vanished from my
mind, and left it fixed in the concluding act of
that astonishing drama, over which the curtain
dropped at Fontainebleau, when Napoleon,
fallen from his high estate, resigned the sovereignty
of Europe, and sealed the death-warrant
of that power which had subdued the world,
and drawn the nations captive at his chariot
wheels. Forgive me, I have broken my resolution,
and am wandering from my purpose; but
I promised more than I find it possible to perform,
a lesson you will say, to my presumption.
No, to pass through such scenes as these, as if
one were travelling over a turnpike-road in the
west of England, would argue something either
above or below human nature; and, as I profess
to be a very mortal of earth, I feel that I
may claim your pardon for my digression. I
<i>could</i> tell you of the softest, stillest, most heavenly
moon that ever lent its silver beams to
heighten a prospect and inspire the genius of
meditation. I <i>could</i> dilate in raptures on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
landscape round Nemours; I <i>could</i> break from
every restraining bond to expatiate on the
transports with which, on arriving at the brow of
the prodigious steep which overhangs Briare, I
first beheld the Loire, rolling through a perfect
Elysium: but I will hasten onwards. <i>You</i>
shall not be detained at Moulins, though we
staid there two days. You shall not halt in the
lovely Nivernois, though we broke down, and
had thence the happiness of remaining for
several hours in one of the sweetest cottages imaginable,
admiring the groups of peasants at
their daily toil, so cheerful&mdash;so picturesque.</p>

<p>At Lyons, too, we rested; visited “Les
Etroits,” though not for the sake of that bad man,
Rousseau; and thence pursued our way. That
odious Charles Emanuel, the tyrant of this
region, haunted me as we passed through Savoy.
It is true that I would fain stand still with you
for a moment on Mont Cenis, and make you
partake of my enthusiasm as I gazed from the
plain of St. Nicholas; but it must not be;
“Hark forward!” must be our motto. There!
I have brought you safely into Turin, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
have not yawned over a single syllable of controversy
respecting the station from which Hannibal
encouraged his army by a sight of the
Italian plains, nor gone to sleep over a single
calculation upon the impossibility of traversing
the Alps with a numerous host of elephants.
My business is not with the truth or falsehood
of Livy’s descriptions at present, though he was
one of our travelling companions; but as I said
before, you have stepped out of your <i>traineau</i>,
and are with whole bones deposited in a large
commodious dwelling in one of the finest streets
of the capital of Piémont.</p>

<p>Thank Heaven, my beloved mother, and her
precious charge, have surmounted the difficulties
of our journey with far less of inconvenience
than I could have anticipated. My uncle
suffers no pain, but his languor increases with
increasing weakness. The wonderful blessings
of the Almighty warm my heart to unspeakable
gratitude; and when I consider the chain
of circumstances attending on the return of this
once dreaded relation to his own country, I
cannot call them less than providential. I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
you not long ago, how happy he is in the removal
of those doubts which harassed his mind;
and no sooner have Mr. Otway and mamma
finished this work, and arrived at a “consummation
so devoutly to have been wished for,”
than the saint-like voice and countenance of
Alfred Stanley “take up the wondrous tale,”
and truth that comes “mended from his
tongue,” by the holy sincerity in which it is
uttered, pours oil and honey over the wounds
so newly cicatrized, and, with a sacred unction,
prepares our dear invalid for his celestial rest.
Of Falkland, like the Alps, I must not speak,
lest I should say too much. His society is the
best consolation which could be offered in the
bereavement of Arthur, and we literally <i>devour</i>
this magic scenery together, with our eyes and
hearts. The beauties of nature are not like
those of art, addressed only to the outward
sense. They captivate the affections, and I
always find that they point my mind to Heaven,
there to glorify that creative wisdom and beneficence,
which saw it good thus to adorn the
earth. We are engaged in planning various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
schemes for seeing the surrounding country,
and only wait to hear from Arthur, and learn
whether we have a chance of his returning, and
accompanying us in the excursion, to make
arrangements for our darling project of visiting
the vallies of the Waldenses. Adieu, dearest
Julia,</p>

<h2>LETTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Frederick Douglas.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Selby.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear Frederick,</p>

<p>Alas! I cannot rejoin your party for the
present. I reached this place with as little delay
as winds, waves, and mail coaches permitted, and
found my poor mother so frightfully altered,
that I should scarcely recognize her at the distance
of a few paces. I was not aware, till I arrived
at home that she had had a paralytic stroke,
which she cannot endure to have known, and
Louisa would not risk the communication by
letter, lest I might, inadvertently, betray a
knowledge of the fact on meeting her. Of this
there is no danger in telling it to <i>you</i>, and in
doing so, I explain at once how impossible it is
for me to quit England while matters remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
their present precarious condition. You will
rejoice to hear that domestic misfortunes have
had the happiest effect on my sister’s mind.
She is wonderfully changed, and her whole attention
is devoted to the melancholy duty of
watching our invalid, whose illness appeared
immediately after a sudden and unlooked for
demand of £2,000 on the miserable Crayton’s
account, accompanied by an earnest request
from Adelaide that her mother would honour
the bill, or, at least, give security for its payment
at a future day. This was impossible, for
my poor mother was overwhelmed by debts of
her own. The grief and mortification which
are now her portion are not rendered more
tolerable by the accompanying reflection that
she brought them on herself; and it is the cruel
nature of her complaint to aggravate every
vexation by the dreadful irritability which is one
of its constant symptoms, as I am informed by
Doctor Leach, who is in daily attendance at
Selby. Need I say that almost every hour is
occupied in endeavouring to soothe our poor
patient, and relieve Louisa’s care? <i>You</i> know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
nothing of the hopeless task which we have
daily to encounter. The life that is led by
fashion’s votaries, ill prepares the mind I see
for finding refuge in the only consolations which
a sick room supplies. How often am I irresistibly
led to a comparison of my uncle’s couch
with that on which my poor mother’s faded
form reclines! We can impart no comfort. We
fail of amusing, as of consoling her. Neither
book nor conversation delights, the affrighted
spirit turns in anguish from viewing the grave
as it gapes beneath, and dares not seek for refuge
in Him who is neglected while the blood
circulates freely in the veins, and the wheel
rolls on, as if it were never to meet obstruction.
I never pondered on these things till I lived at
Glenalta, and I am now endeavouring to impress
them on Louisa. Cards are my poor
mother’s only resource, and my sister, Turner,
and I, are in constant requisition. We play
whist to amuse her, and suffer her to win every
game. Perhaps by keeping her mind as calm
and unruffled as possible, I may prevail with
her to see Mr. Arundel, an excellent clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in our neighbourhood, who has often proffered
his service, but whose visits she has hitherto
declined. The Doctor gives me no hope of
her recovery, though he thinks that she may endure
repeated attacks before her strength sinks
entirely under them. Some of the good people
of our country are loud, I am told in their abuse
of my sister, and me, for permitting a card
inside my mother’s apartment. We ought,
they say, to <i>insist</i> on her seeing Mr. Arundel,
and oblige her to listen to pious reading.
Alas! what mischief may be wrought even by
the best intentions, when zeal is so wholly unaccompanied
by discretion! Should we hope to
render a temper fitter for Heaven by exciting
its utmost animosity, or secure a reception in
the heart for doctrines <i>forced</i> upon the ear?
So certain am I of the contrary, that I will
take the whole responsibility on myself, and
trust that the motive which impels me to brave
the opinion of several who are older than I am,
may insure forgiveness, if I am wrong. Ask
Stanley for his advice, and tell Falkland to
write to me. You must remember the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that Louisa and I are leading, and have pity
on us. Let me hear often from you, and tell
my dear Emily, and Charlotte, that I think a
few words of cousinly kindness would produce a
happy effect upon my poor sister’s mind; she
would find too, perhaps, an interesting recreation
in corresponding with them. It is a distressing
circumstance to me, that I know not
where to address Adelaide, nor does she
know where to find me. Of her situation I
must remain ignorant, till Annesley can trace
the route by which she and her unfortunate
husband have evaded pursuit. My dear uncle’s
noble gift shall be forwarded to Milan for the
payment of debts, and we must, if practicable,
purchase off the prosecution for Castelli’s death.
You will assist me, I am sure, in every possible
way. God bless you, dearest Frederick.

<h2>LETTER XLIV.<br />
<span class="smcap">Frederick Douglas to Arthur Howard.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Turin.</i></p>

<p class="salutation">My dear Arthur,</p>

<p>An entire month has passed since the date of
my last letter to you; and I have now to recount
an adventure which has deeply interested
me, and will, I have no doubt, produce as
much excitement in your mind as it has done
in my own. When we had been at Turin
about ten days, Mr. Otway, Emily, and I, returned
late one evening from a <i>scramble</i>
amongst the rocky scenery by which we are surrounded,
and found George Bentley seated
with the rest of the party. You may imagine
that the meeting affected us all. Poor fellow,
he is a sincere mourner for his uncle’s loss, and
is grown more serious than I ever saw him;
but he is one whom I shall always love, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
all felt at sight of him as if Glenalta had come
over to pay us a visit. After George had rested
for a day or two we made our final arrangements,
which had been pending for some time
previous to his arrival, for the projected excursion
into the vallies. It was ruled in congress
that we juniors should not all desert the home
party together; and as it was considered likely
that at a future day when you rejoin us, another
<i>sortie</i> may be determined upon; Stanley volunteered
in remaining with my uncle, while
Fanny begged to be left as guardian of my
mother.</p>

<p>To begin then, methodically, you may fancy
the travelling party consisting of Mr. Otway,
Falkland, George Bentley, Emily, Charlotte,
and myself, in full march, on the fifteenth
ultimo, issuing from the Posta Nuova, and taking
the high road to Pinerolo. The Po rolled
impetuously on its course, and brought to my
mind those lines of Virgil, which describe its
rushing flood, when swelled by the tributary
waters of spring:&mdash;</p>

<p>appeared as just a character as could be given
of this classic river, as we passed along for some
miles in view of its winding course. The
beautiful plains of the Cottian Alps were left
behind us, when we quitted Pinerolo, and we
soon opened on the rugged scenery which surrounds
Pomaretto, which we entered on foot, so
difficult was its approach. The valley of
Perosa had much to interest us. We passed
through that of Pragella, and wondered at the
dreariness of the prospect.</p>

before us.</p>

<p>For the particulars of four delightful days
spent in traversing the vallies of St. Martino,
Clusone, and Luzerna, I shall refer you to our
journals, which faithfully describe, and circumstantially
narrate all that we saw and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
during our progress. I must hasten on to
“metal more attractive” still, in the exquisite
loveliness of San Giovanni. At La
Torre we were arrested, as if by a spell of
magical enchantment. There we halted during
two days: visited the monument of Christina,
sister of Elizabeth Smith, talked over Victor
Amadeus with detestation, of the noble Henri
Arnaud with enthusiasm, and were so lost in
admiration of the Alpine beauties, and simple
manners by which we were so hemmed in on
every side, that after a week’s sojournment
in this fascinating vale, we should all have been
likely to forget the whole of what is called the
civilized world, if certain thoughts of Turin,
Selby, and Glenalta, had not been interwoven
with the raptures to which we resigned ourselves.
From La Torre, however, we <i>tore</i> ourselves
(I am not so unworthy as to <i>commit</i> a <i>pun</i>
amidst the mountains of Switzerland), and proceeded
to Angrogna. Here we <i>called a halt</i>,
and the result of our deliberations was, that the
two girls being intent on achieving, if practicable,
the difficult ascent of La Vachera, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
visiting the famous Pre du Tour, it was judged
expedient that they should remain quietly
housed in the village of Angrogna, while some
of the party, in quality of scouts, were to reconnoitre,
and returning to the rendezvous, declare
how far it might be possible for the ladies to
realize their daring resolution.</p>

<p>The post of danger is the post of honour,
and it might therefore be supposed that the
gentlemen of our detachment were all ambitious
of being heroes, and immortalizing their names
amongst the brave of other days, who had vanquished
or fallen near this impregnable fortress
of nature’s workmanship; but no such thing,
Mr. Otway honestly avowed that his love of
adventure was cooled in the stream of time,
and that, with the perils of the expedition he
would surrender all title to a share in its glories.
This was fair and reasonable, suitable to his
years, and according with his generosity.
But what will you say of Master Falkland,
when I tell you that his youthful blood boiled
not with either martial or romantic ardour?
Protesting against the ungallant proceeding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
leaving two damsels in the care of <i>one</i> knight,
he sent forward Bentley and your humble
servant to meet all the hazard of the undertaking.
In short, George and I were decreed
to be “<i>les enfans perdus</i>,” while Falkland, not
contented with the privileges of exemption from
our toils, laid claim to the rewards of chivalry,
and sought in Emily’s approving smile a full
ratification of his cowardly choice. <i>Yes</i>, Charles,
if I mistake not, is no longer <i>compos mentis</i>;
and if so, we must not be too hard upon him.
I set out with George upon the most interesting
perambulation I ever made in my life. We
took a guide, and, followed by a peasant boy,
struck out of the beaten track, and wandered for
several hours through the Valleys of the Waldenses,
amid pathless defiles of rock and glen,
which presented such matchless variety, such
astonishing contrast of the beautiful and sublime,
as I should in vain attempt to pourtray with any
hope of doing justice to the scenery.</p>

<p>On our return we gave a glowing picture of
the romantic beauties which crowned our exertions,
and engaged to pilot my sisters and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
beaux into the defiles of the adjacent mountains
on the following day, which we performed
admirably, Emily and Charlotte bringing such
freshness of Kerry practice to the task, that
they struck our guides with the deepest astonishment.
We made acquaintance in our way with
several peasants, who charmed us by the ease
and simplicity of their manners. All the adventitious
distinctions which by introducing inequality,
bring also in its train condescension
on the one hand, meanness, servility, awkwardness,
and presumption on the other, are unknown
in the Valleys of Piémont. Here man
is reduced to his <i>elemental</i> character: stars and
garters, which glitter in the murky atmosphere
of courts, and there assume the “<i>Lux lucet in
tenebris</i>,” hide their diminished heads, and dare
not radiate their sickly lustre in presence of
that glorious luminary which seems to disport
with peculiar rapture in this region of eternal
snows, and to play off all the magic versatility
of his powers, amid these giant prisms that
reflect, and refract his beams in every possible
variety of form and colour. Were I <i>in love</i>, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
should grow like one of the <i>lichens</i> to these
rocks, but as I am enabled to sing</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>I prefer returning to the full tide of life, and
coming from time to time to enjoy these fastnesses
of nature with all the stimulus of contrast,
added to their intrinsic sublimity. Emily
wept as we left the banks of the Pelice on our
return to Turin. Though longing to be with
those who were left behind, and carrying with
her the society which had lent its charms to the
desert, her tears flowed as an irresistible tribute
to scenes so congenial to her heart. Charlotte
used to be always considered by us to live more
in a world of <i>sentiment</i> than her elder sister,
yet her eyes were not suffused; and though her
pencil and her voice have borne away unnumbered
memoranda from the mountains, she repassed
the Porta Nuova with such transport,
that I could scarcely keep her in the carriage
and prevent her from running a race with the
animals that were doing their best to reunite us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with the group which we felt impatient to
embrace.</p>

<p>Alas, my dear uncle has been very ill
during our absence, and is much changed within
these few days of our separation from him. We
found my beloved mother looking pale from
want of sleep, but rejoicing in the blessing of
beholding the triumph of Faith and Hope, in
the approaching scene which we cannot flatter
ourselves is not in immediate prospect. Stanley,
she says, is a celestial messenger.</p>

<p>Your next accounts of my poor aunt, will, I
hope, be more favourable. Stanley entirely approves
of your conciliating her affections by all
the means in your power; and has no doubt
that they are the very best handmaids to religion.
He bids me say that you must not be
discouraged if you cannot prevail at <i>first</i>. Be
patient, and even five minutes seriously employed,
when the heart is sincere, will not
be <i>lost</i>.</p>

<h2>LETTER XLV.<br />
<span class="smcap">Emily Douglas to Julia Sandford.</span></h2>

<p class="where"><i>Turin.</i></p>

<p>Oh, my dearest Julia, in what words shall
I describe the horror and consternation in
which we have been thrown by the awful event
mentioned to your aunt in Alfred Stanley’s last
letter? A week has passed since the dreadful
catastrophe, and I have not slept since, so great
is the shock that it produced. The particulars
are as I will now endeavour to detail them.</p>

<p>On the evening of this day se’nnight we were
returning, a numerous party, from a walk in
the direction of Rivoli, when passing by a large
house removed at a little distance from the outskirts
of this town, and separated from the road
by a thick plantation, we were violently startled
by the noise of a pistol-shot, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
shriek so piercing, that I shall never cease to
remember its shrillness. Mr. Otway, Fanny,
Charles Falkland, and I, were foremost, and
reached the spot whence these affrighting sounds
proceeded before the rest came up; and
scarcely had we arrived opposite the door, ere
a frantic figure rushed from it, and fell down at
our feet! Charles and Mr. Otway raised her
from the earth, but she was pale as death, and
quite insensible. I ran eagerly to a stream
which was just by, and filling the crown of my
straw hat with water, was hastening back, when
I perceived that she was supported by a young
and beautiful woman in deep mourning, who
was recognized at the first glance by Fanny
to be the Madame de Lisle, of whom I told you
in a former letter. The object of our anxiety
remained motionless, while the gentlemen, who
were now joined by Alfred, George, and Frederick,
flew into the house, where all was confusion:
servants running to and fro; some of
whom were employed in placing the body of a
young man, who had just blown his brains out,
on a bed. It was growing dark, and the shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the trees rendered it impossible to see any
thing clearly; but on Frederick’s return from
the house, where some of the people had told
him that the lady who had fainted was wife to
Monsieur le Marchand, who was a <i>negociant</i>
from Bourdeaux, and had destroyed himself in
consequence, they supposed of bad news contained
in a letter which he had received on that
day, he pressed forward to take her in his arms
for the purpose of laying her on a mattrass
which he had had brought out; and no sooner
did the light fall directly on her corpse-like features,
than Frederick exclaimed, “Good God!
Adelaide Crayton! She is the very image of
her portrait in Grosvenor Square!” The agitation
produced by this discovery is more easily
imagined than described. Adelaide, for she was
indeed our unfortunate cousin, was removed;
and as she was raised up a locket fell upon
the ground, which contained hair, with a coronet
and the letter C. in diamonds. This ornament
confirmed my brother’s belief; but she was
silent, her pulse appeared to cease, and the livid
paleness of her countenance, gave reason to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that her spirit would not revive. Oh! who
amongst us had heart to wish that her eyes
should open again on such a scene? Yet
open they did, at last, but it was only to utter
another shriek, and look wildly round for an
instant, after which, half uttering the name
of La Tour, she relapsed into the same inanimate
state from which she had but just
awakened. We had sent for a surgeon, who
was now conducted to the mattrass on which
Adelaide lay by a young woman, who, on being
questioned, I found was La Tour, and <i>femme de
chambre</i> to my poor cousin. In reply to my inquiries,
she told me, with very little feeling,
that Le Marchand was a feigned name, that
Lord Crayton, after killing Signior Castelli,
was obliged to fly; that his extravagance knew
no bounds, and that he played enormously high;
that an hour before the fatal act of suicide he
saw a person pass the windows of the room in
which he sat, whom he recognized as a Milan
man to whom he owed a large sum of money;
and irritated by finding that he was no longer
concealed, he resolved on the desperate deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which was hardly resolved on ere it was perpetrated.
His pistols were charged, and in the
presence of his wife he put one of them to his
mouth, and was dead in an instant! I said
something expressive of pity for the survivor,
and was not a little shocked by La Tour’s reply,
“Ma’amselle, ne vous mettez pas en
peine, madame se consolera bientôt.”</p>

<p>I turned from this woman with abhorrence,
just as Mr. Otway, who had been employed in
examining the servants, came back to the place
where we were surrounding Adelaide, and trying
every method for her recovery. Madame
de Lisle was kneeling at my side, and engaged
in rubbing one of poor Adelaide’s hands, when
Mr. Otway changed colour as his eyes met
her’s. He seemed on the point of speaking,
but repressed whatever he was going to say;
and I concluded that he had mistaken her for
one of us in the confusion of the moment.
At length the surgeon succeeded in recalling
poor Lady Crayton’s senses, and she was carried
to her bed, where Frederick and I resolved
to watch by her during the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
George Bentley and Charles Falkland insisted
on remaining below stairs, and Mr. Otway
took charge of Charlotte and Fanny, whom he
hurried home to apprize mamma of the events
of the evening. They found her so far prepared
for the dreadful intelligence, that she
knew through Mr. Stanley, whom we begged
to hasten to our hotel, that a gentleman
had shot himself, in consequence of which we
were delayed, but she had yet to learn the melancholy
particulars of the catastrophe, and that we were endeavouring to
be of use to our near relations.</p>

<p>Madame de Lisle was like a sister, she and
her maid remained with us all night; and there
was nothing that sympathy and tenderness
could dictate which this lovely young woman
did not offer to us in the way of assistance.
Mamma thought my uncle too ill to listen to an
account of what had happened, and till the
morning she did not come to me, as she judged
it better that Adelaide should continue in perfect
quiet. A sleeping-dose had been administered,
and she lay in a sort of stupor, interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
from time to time by words uttered in delirium:
“Where are my jewels?” “Did you see Castelle?”
“When will Arthur come?” were
the only sentences that Frederick and I could
hear distinctly, though she’ talked a great deal,
and apparently with anger at intervals. It was
determined upon to remove her as quickly as
possible from the theatre of such horror, and
accordingly apartments were immediately prepared
in a house adjoining that in which we
live. The body was disposed of, and every arrangement
that we could devise carried into
effect with the utmost celerity to change the
scene for Adelaide.</p>

<p>When I look back upon the last week, the
whole appears like a terrific dream! For an
hour together I never lose sight of that corse,
weltering in its blood; nor cease to think of that
spirit, hurried into the presence of its God!
The subject is too awful, and the mind will not
dwell upon it. I sometimes feel as if I should
lose my senses. Adelaide seems quite unconscious
of all that has happened, and never mentions
her husband. The physician assures us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that she is not in danger unless the fever increase.</p>

<p>After the lapse of many days I find my letter
only half written; but anxiety thickens upon us,
and my Julia will excuse me. My poor aunt
Howard’s situation is so precarious, that we
know not what a day may bring forth. My
dear uncle declines, alas, too visibly to leave
a doubt that the dreaded moment is at hand!
and though Lady Crayton is recovering rapidly,
she is, to my eye, a more melancholy object than
even death itself. La Tour’s words vibrate on
my senses: they are a true picture; “<i>elle se
consolera bientôt!</i>” Yes; <i>elle se console</i>, and
with so little reference to <i>decency</i>, that though
at the arrival of every English mail we expect
the <i>last</i> accounts of her mother’s existence, and
her husband’s bleeding image seems to dwell
amongst us, <i>she</i> is able to talk of indifferent
matters, and her only solicitude literally appears
at present to display itself only in contrivances
for rendering her weeds becoming. She wishes
for Arthur, <i>not</i> that she may enjoy a brother’s
sympathy, but to know the utmost that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
done to make her independent. On hearing
from mamma that a considerable sum had
been remitted for the payment of Lord Crayton’s
debts in Milan, conceive her proposing
that Arthur should be written to directly, to
desire that he might reserve this money for
her use, and leave her husband’s debts unpaid!
Oh, Julia, poor Adelaide was not worse than
others by nature; and is this the end of a
fashionable education?</p>

<p>I am sick at heart, and turn from the contemplation
of my cousin’s future career to rest
on the pleasing thought of Madame de Lisle,
with whom we are delighted. Though evidently
bent on seclusion, and desirous of avoiding
even a limited society, she would not refuse
<i>us</i> the pleasure of calling upon her; and,
from her first interview with mamma, she has
not required that we should again solicit her
acquaintance. I never saw such sympathy between
two beings so far separated by different
age and country.</p>

<p>I told you that I had remarked a change
in Mr. Otway’s colour when he first saw this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
deeply interesting young woman. Since that
time he has been minutely inquiring about the
handkerchief which Fanny picked up, and is
fully confirmed by the letters marked upon it
in the belief that he has known her family in
former days, and seen her when a child; but
some circumstances, which I am unable to
fathom, deter him from putting any question to
her that might determine the point. Perhaps
she married without the consent of her friends;
yet she seems so good that it would take much
evidence to convince me that she had ever
made her parents unhappy. Again, were she
not so perfectly elegant, so modest and refined
in her ways of thinking, it might be supposed
that she had conformed to the vulgar views of
high life, by marrying some mere man of
fashion, in whom she had been disappointed,
and by whom, perhaps, she may have been
left to mourn over conduct, at the remembrance
of which she blushes; but Madame de Lisle
<i>cannot</i> be a hypocrite, and if not her husband
must have been worthy of her. No ignoble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
motive could have induced this sweet and lovely
creature to bestow her hand without her heart.
Whatever be the reason, she desires concealment,
and we alone, I believe, constitute her
attraction to Turin. If Mr. Otway be right
in his conjecture, she is the daughter of an
English nobleman; but he will not tell us
more till he brings the matter to a certainty.</p>

<p>I am this moment informed, that a letter
is just received by Frederick from Arthur, announcing
his mother’s death. Excellent young
man! he rejoices in the idea of having been
with her, and enabled, to the last moment,
to minister to her comfort. He speaks of her
tranquil exit with feelings of the deepest gratitude
to heaven; and mentions, that she had
from time to time derived the greatest relief
from unburthening her heart to an admirable
clergyman, who visited her frequently in the
latter days of her life.</p>

<p>The letters which informed the family at
Selby of all that had taken place here, had not
reached England when Arthur wrote. It is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
intention to come here as soon as possible,
accompanied by my cousin Louisa.</p>

<p>You shall hear regularly from me of all that
passes.</p>

<h2>LETTER XLVI.<br />
<span class="smcap">From Arthur Howard to the Reader.</span></h2>

<p class="salutation">My dear Reader,</p>

<p>If you have travelled thus far with me, you
and I are kind friends; and I am, in duty
bound, to do my best for your gratification.
I told you, long ago, my motives for raking and
rummaging through sundry trunks where papers
were deposited, for the letters which I have
picked out of an immense heap, and strung together&mdash;<i>shall
I venture</i> to say for your amusement?
That I was fired with the hope of
affording you some entertainment is certain;
but people often fail when they are most
anxious to succeed; and the size of my manuscript
begins to frighten me.</p>

<p>On returning to Glenalta, in the peaceful
shades of which the idea first occurred to me of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
addressing you, I found, as you may imagine,
much difficulty in collecting my materials, and
making choice from amongst them, to say nothing
of arranging and transcribing; but this
trouble, and much more, I would willingly take
for any one who has liked me sufficiently to
accompany my steps during a period of nearly
four years. If I resolve, then, on tying up the
numerous packets which still lie piled on the
table before me; and returning them to their
several caskets to be forwarded to their rightful
owners, it is not that I am tired of working for
you, but I am afraid of fatiguing you, and
losing your society, which has hitherto afforded
me so much pleasure, that I would not for any
consideration lose my hold on your regard,
which our good fellowship during so long a
journey may lead me to hope that I possess.</p>

<p>Actuated by these friendly feelings, it occurs
to me that I will tell you the rest of the story
myself, not, believe me, from the vain-glorious
motive of desiring to push myself into an undue
degree of notice, nor of securing that
which attaches to the <i>last</i> speaker, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
following reasons: First, my dear good friend,
we are all alive and merry, I mean we who have
written all the mounds of paper through which
you have waded so patiently; and <i>therefore</i> you
cannot expect a regular <i>end</i> of what is still
<i>going on</i>; nor can I keep my book open any
longer, lest you might suppose it <i>endless</i>, and
throw it aside. Secondly, some of our party came
to be involved in writing of another kind, and in
the necessity of encountering law business, with
which I could not think of wearying you, and
thus had less time for the employment of their
pens upon more interesting subjects. Again,
other individuals of our society became gradually
so devoted to each other’s conversation,
that with grief of heart I saw myself in danger
of losing the best contributors to my scheme.
And you know if people will not separate for
the accommodation of a compiler, adieu to
letter-writing. In short, I grew very uneasy
and after suffering those pangs which authors
only understand, I determined on throwing up
my correspondence, taking the matter at once
into my own hands, and relieving your curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
respecting people and things which I
have been the means of introducing to your
acquaintance.</p>

<p>You are able, no doubt, to anticipate a great
deal, but that is no reason why I should not tell
you all I know. And first you shall have such
information as I can give you respecting Madame
de Lisle, who has been rather abruptly
introduced to your acquaintance in a letter from
Emily Douglas. The letter to which Miss
Douglas refers, for the history of Madame de
Lisle, has been unfortunately lost; and you
must therefore be contented with such particulars
as I have collected since I had the pleasure
of an introduction to her acquaintance. Mr.
Otway one day saw her so violently agitated
by Stanley’s occasional mention of a person
who is a friend of his, and whose name is
Alured, that he resolved at once on removing
his doubts relating to her parentage. Alured
was a family name in the pedigree to which
he believed her to belong, and he was right.
He went alone to visit her, and soon discovered
that she was indeed Lady Laura Penshurst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the only surviving daughter of the proud
and pompous Earl of Alton, whose sister he
had loved in early life, before the “thick coming”
honours of her house had tacked a title to
her name. This disclosure once made, Lady
Laura took Mr. Otway at once into her confidence,
and told him that her mother, whose
memory she adores, died a few months ago in
the south of France, having survived Lord
Alton, to whom no mortal could be attached,
but three years. Her brother succeeded to the
title and estates, and enjoyed them but a very
short time, when he too was swept off the mortal
stage, and they descended to an infant who is
the present Lord Alton. Disgusted with the
world in which she no longer possessed an object
of affection, Lady Laura determined on
remaining abroad, assuming a name and style
which should protect her from curiosity, and
ending her days where her mother’s remains
were deposited.</p>

<p>Of our good friend, George Bentley, I
have news which will probably surprise you
not a little. He often talked, during our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rambles in Switzerland, of taking up his abode
in the midst of the romantic scenery which
had excited our admiration. His declarations
were received as the mere effusions of the
moment, and we never believed him in earnest
until he seriously declared his determination
to carry his project into effect, and took
decisive measures for the purpose. He went
to Ireland, made arrangements of his property,
by which he provided for three or
four relations, who are all of his family that
remain; settled an annual bounty on the parish
poor, annuities on the old retainers, left Mount
Prospect to be let by Mr. Oliphant, returned to
Piémont, and was, ere long, established in a
cottage near Angrogna.</p>

<p>General Douglas, his sister, and Mr. Otway,
exerted all their skill in rhetoric to dissuade
George from deserting his native country. They
represented most forcibly that inversion of mind
by which people, neglecting the good that lies
within their grasp, bend all their energies to
distant objects. They endeavoured to convince
him that so much remained to be done at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that it was criminal to quit the post in which
heaven had placed him, and yielding to a spirit
of adventure, instead of being governed by the
sober desire of usefulness, prefer the notoriety
of this romantic scheme, to the less shewy, but
more valuable purpose of being a kind landlord,
and a resident gentleman in his native land.</p>

<p>Bentley’s principal fault is obstinacy, which
he sometimes mistakes for firmness. He had
<i>determined</i>, and was ready with more fluency of
words, than depth of argument, to answer the
reasoning of his friends. “He thought that a
<i>call</i> should not be resisted. He considered the
remarkable chain of events which had brought
him into the Vallies of Piémont, as a providential
appointment, a cord that drew him invisibly
forward to his true destiny.” In vain was it
urged in reply, that <i>such</i> arguments would
legitimatize every absurd dereliction of duty,
every wild vagary of adventure; and were
fantasies like these permitted to carry conviction
to the understanding, a country might
be drained of all its inhabitants who were
capable of exerting beneficial influence within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
its circuit, and the population be committed to
anarchy and want.</p>

<p>Bentley remained fixed as a rock, and perhaps,
secretly gloried in the double character
of martyr and missionary, since he now encountered
what he technically denominated
“<i>persecution</i>.” To the Vallies he <i>would</i> go,
and perhaps the <i>real</i> motive may never be fully
revealed to his own mind, though we lookers on
could not help perceiving very clearly, that the
devoted and mutual attachment of Falkland
and Emily Douglas, had been the <i>true</i> pivot on
which his purposes turned. Love, in its common
acceptation, never found a place in Bentley’s
breast. He never knew what it was to be
impelled either by ungovernable passion, which
hurries some to ruin and abasement; nor was
his heart formed to those all-powerful, but
delicate sympathies, which though fine as
threads of gossamer, yet irresistibly entangle
the affections, and produce entire dependence
for happiness on the reciprocal devotion of a
beloved object. No, Bentley had seen that men
and women usually marry. He had therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
contemplated marriage for himself. He saw
children in most families, and without loving
them, he supposed that he should one day be a
father, as well as husband; but the utmost
which his mind had ever accomplished in reducing
these wide abstractions and “loose generalities,”
to any practical bearing on his individual
lot, was summed up in the following
hypothesis. “If I should ever think of engaging
myself to any woman, and resigning my
present freedom, become a married man, I
must endeavour to select a suitable companion;
money is a sordid motive, though it is a necessary
adjunct; beauty is a fading flower, yet the
eye is fascinated by its charms; intellect is inspiring,
but it often leads to vanity; religion is
essential, but how do we know it to be sincere.
If I <i>were</i> to think of marrying, I wish that it
might be to Emily Douglas; but would she
marry me?” These <i>ifs</i> and <i>ands</i>, had been so
often laid before the imagination of George
Bentley, that they became as habitual as breakfast,
dinner, and sleep, probably occupying at
stated intervals that period of <i>coma</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
intervenes between a full meal and a sound
slumber, till by daily recurrence of Emily’s
image, he had marked her insensibly for his
own, and that too, without the slightest degree
of personal presumption either respecting his
powers of pleasing, or her feelings towards him.
When, therefore, his eyes were first opened to
the truth that Emily loved, and was beloved by
another, he woke, as from a dream. He was
astounded, puzzled. He felt unsettled, set
adrift, or, perhaps like an owl when it is suddenly
brought into the sun’s light from the tranquil
shade of its ivied tower. At last, however,
his mental optics accommodated themselves to a
new focus. He was no longer confused, and
his eyes were no longer dim. He then began
to examine himself, and was obliged to make
the inward confession, that no one had injured
him. He was not in love. He had never given
any one reason to suppose that he felt more
than friendship, and all the Douglas family
treated him with unvarying kindness and affection
which had never passed that sober limit;
but things are not so easily settled with pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Bentley’s had in reality nothing to do in the
matter, for <i>his</i> had not received offence, yet by
some extraordinary fancy, he <i>did</i> appear to take
umbrage at the attachment, which was evident;
and he did so perhaps, because he did not at
first perceive it, and at the critical time of its
becoming manifest to his senses, the expedition
to the Vallies, opened a new vista to his
mind, and gave an unexpected bias to his
resolutions.</p>

<p>Frederick and I were hammering at something
not far removed from this statement, when
Mr. Otway came into the room, and in five
minutes drew up the case as I have recorded
it.</p>

<p>As time rolled on, the delightful mother of
Emily Douglas, was called upon to approve a
union which cannot fail of happiness. Emily
and Charles Falkland are formed for each other.
Virtue and talents lend all their influence to lay
a solid foundation, while the lighter graces
which belong to manners and accomplishments,
give a finish to the charm that binds them to
each other. Simplicity is a decided characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of both; and when the day arrived which
General Douglas begged to hasten, in order
that he might bestow a blessing with ten thousand
pounds, which he presented to his niece
there was no idle parade of dress and equipage.
Not a single preparation which had display for
its object, or vanity for its motive, marked this
nuptial scene. It was the only marriage, except
her sister’s, at which Louisa Howard had ever assisted,
and what a contrast did it not present to
the gorgeous folly of poor Adelaide’s hymeneals?
A short tour to Geneva, Lausanne and
Vevay, separated the Falklands but a little
time from Turin, to which place they returned,
and the dying couch of a beloved uncle was attended
with all the tenderness which true affection
can alone inspire. He lingered till winter
had clothed the Alps in a fresh mantle of snow,
and breathed his last in the arms of Frederick.
Some months of repose were necessary to the
shattered health of Mrs. Douglas, and she preferred
remaining in Switzerland till the following
spring, when the whole party arrived in
safety at Marsden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Emily’s marriage afforded a pretext
for selling off the English property according
to the <i>letter</i> of General Douglas’ will,
his sister considered that to delay its sale was
more in agreement with the <i>spirit</i> of his intentions,
and she had consequently no hesitation
in determining that Frederick should try the
experiment of remaining in Hampshire for some
time, while her son, implicitly relying on the
counsels of his mother, acquiesced with alacrity
in whatever she thought right. Marsden became
the abode of whatever most exalts human
nature, and the Douglas family possess the art
of rendering virtue and knowledge attractive in
such a degree, that their anxiety is to avoid, not
to court acquaintance with the great. Their
society is universally sought after, and none
can exceed it.</p>

<p>Emily and her husband, as the <i>avant couriers</i>
of Mrs. Douglas, accompanied Mr. Otway to
Ireland, and have purchased Mount Prospect,
to which they have given its ancient Irish appellation
of Cairndruid, and which they are altering
and beautifying, for their future home, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
family of Glenalta shall return to their dearly-loved
abode.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliphant, who is a perfect pattern of
what every clergyman ought to be, and aided in
his pious labours by an excellent sister, lives but
to do good and make his parishioners happy.
When he saw the circle of those friends, so
justly valued, once more in their accustomed
places, his glistening eye and uplifted hands
seemed to say with old Simeon, “Let thy servant
now depart in peace.”</p>

<p>The Sandfords, Stanleys, Mrs. Fitzroy, and
various other agreeable people have had happy
meetings at Marsden; and I will venture a prophecy,
that Frederick, who longs to regain his
native shores, will one day prevail upon the
elegant Julia Sandford to bear him company
thither. If strongly tempted, too, to lay a
wager, though I do not consider <i>bets</i> to be the
most convincing arguments, I might be persuaded
to risk a few pounds upon the probability
of two other matches, viz. one between
Charlotte Douglas and Algernon Stanhope, and
the other between an elder brother of Stanley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and Louisa Howard. As to my own loves, if I
have any, my dear Reader, you cannot expect
me to divulge them: “Sink or swim, I carry
my secrets with me,” which was the sagacious
resolve of Mrs. Faulkner, wife to the celebrated
George, of editorial memory, who asked her, on
her death-bed, whether or not she had been a
faithful <i>sposa</i>.</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear that Lawrence cleans
the gravel walks still at Glenalta, and is never
weary of recounting stories to his young mistress
when she walks in the shrubbery, of all that had
happened in her absence, Lisfarne looks glad
once more, and the Beacon Hill is burned to
brown from all the fires that have spread their
glow over the beautiful bay which it overlooks.</p>

<p>Aunt Douglas shall close my narrative: she
is the centre round which all these numerous
rays converge, and the nearer they advance to
her, the more nearly do they approach each
other. How can human beings unite sincerely
in loving the same object, and be at enmity
amongst themselves? It is impossible. A year’s
probation has so assured this self-denying mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
that Marsden can never rival Glenalta in
the hearts of her children, that a treaty is now
on foot for disposing of a place which possesses
no associations with past time to endear it to
their memory. Frederick remains to complete
the contract, and has hopes of bringing old Mr.
Bolton with him to pay a visit in the Emerald
Isle, which he has never seen, while it has fallen
to my happy lot to attend the homeward bound
group, Louisa making one of the party, and
behold such joy as language fails me to describe.
The roads were lined with happy
faces, and welcome resounded from every
mouth. Each step of the way produced increasing
interest, till, in that verandah where I
first met her sweet smile, I saw Glenalta’s
guardian angel folded in the arms of her
daughter.</p>

<p>Now, gentle reader, remember that it is not
many years since I was one of that heartless
multitude who laugh at all that they either do
not comprehend, or that violates the rules
which tyrant fashion imposes on her worshippers.
I am, therefore, prepared for a shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of those epithets which I should once have
liberally bestowed upon a book compounded of
such materials as I have employed in mine.
“Puerile”&mdash;“moral”&mdash;“prosy”&mdash;“dull,” are
sounds familiar to my ear; and if they should
be applied to me by those who still belong to
the fraternity which I have quitted, I trust for
ever, I must submit, yet not without reminding
them, that I held out no <i>false colours</i>. I warned
them of what was coming, and desired to be
thrown aside at once by all who opened my
pages, in expectation of finding a Novel full of
striking events, or numerous incidents. I have
been occupied in representing domestic life,
and giving peeps into real character, not in furnishing
scenes for the poet or the painter. But,
though I am fully prepared both for yawners
and revilers, I dare to cherish a hope, that
some of those whose suffrage would repay me
for a world of contumely, may find amusement
as well as truth in my sketches. Amongst the
fair sex I ought to be kindly received, for my
anxious desire has been to assert their claims;
and by endeavouring to exorcise the demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of <i>Blueism</i>, restore them to their just inheritance.</p>

<p>In order to this recovery of female birthright,
I have attempted to illustrate in the memoirs
of the Douglas family, <i>that</i> compatibility
so frequently denied between the highest intellectual
attainment, and the sweetest humility
of heart I have tried to convince all who are
not wilfully blind, that we have still under other
names, our Lady Jane Greys, and Margaret
Ropers, and that they can be as lovely and as
feminine at the present moment, as in the age
when those bright examples of excellence
adorned society with their graces, virtues, and
talents, though living under the tyranny of
arbitrary government, while ours is the boasted
æra of freedom, and “the <i>march</i> of <i>mind</i>.”
Whatever be my fate, I must now bid you
farewell. Even the kindest friends must part.
Adieu, then, my dear reader. May you and I
shake hands in affectionate brotherhood wherever
we meet. If <i>you</i> were always of opinion
that religion and virtue are indispensable to
happiness; and that the most agreeable people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in the world may also be the best; you have an
advantage over me in never having strayed
from the truth; but inasmuch as I have erred, I
am desirous to proclaim my recantation, and
returning to the nick-named Glenalta, lay down
the follies of my youth, and sign myself a sincere
and penitent convert.</p>

Novel</span>. In 3 vols. post 8vo. 28s. 6d.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“This is an extremely piquant and ingenious satire on politicians
of all parties and denominations. In its pages, the aristocratical,
gentlemanly, twaddling whig; the interested, profligate
tory; the democratical declaimer; the pompous, empty man in
office; and though last, not least, the surfeited and satisfied high
churchman; all figure in their most ludicrous phrases&mdash;nor should
we omit to mention, that the conceited utilitarian comes in for

<p>“The Arabian Tales possess other charms to recommend them,
besides the abundance of the marvellous and supernatural which
they contain, namely, the vivid picture they present of the customs,
manners, prejudices, and every thing in the slightest degree
referring to the nations among whom the wondrous incidents
they relate are supposed to have occurred. Will it not,
then, be a sufficient recommendation of these volumes to state
that they fall by no means short of their greatly admired predecessors
in this respect? Indeed, several of these Tales are more
than either works of fiction, or pictures of the customs, manners,
&amp;c. of the nations of which they treat. Some of them will be
found to contain much excellent moral instruction and philosophical
reflection. The imaginative and descriptive parts will be
found equally interesting and beautiful.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
